<p>It having been frequently stated in print that the book called
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was got up expressly against the popish 
agitation, in the years 1850-51, the author takes this 
opportunity of saying that the principal part of that book was 
written in the year &rsquo;43, that the whole of it was completed
before the termination of the year &rsquo;46, and that it was in 
the hands of the publisher in the year &rsquo;48.&nbsp; And here 
he cannot forbear observing, that it was the duty of that 
publisher to have rebutted a statement which he knew to be a 
calumny; and also to have set the public right on another point 
dealt with in the Appendix to the present work, more especially 
as he was the proprietor of a review enjoying, however 
undeservedly, a certain sale and reputation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But 
take your own part, boy!<br />
For if you don&rsquo;t, no one will take it for you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; the author feels that 
he has no reason to be ashamed of it.&nbsp; In writing that book 
he did his duty, by pointing out to his country people the 
nonsense which, to the greater part of them, is as the breath of 
their nostrils, and which, if indulged in, as it probably will 
be, to the same extent as hitherto, will, within a very few 
years, bring the land which he most loves beneath a foreign yoke:
he does not here allude to the yoke of Rome.</p>
<p>Instead of being ashamed, has he not rather cause to be proud 
of a book which has had the honour of being rancorously abused 
and execrated by the very people of whom the country has least 
reason to be proud?</p>

coarse apparel, paid him no consideration whatever.&nbsp; The 
Cogia saw that he had no chance of notice; so going out, he 
hurried to his house, and, putting on a splendid pelisse, 
returned to the place of festival.&nbsp; No sooner did he enter 
the door than the masters advanced to meet him, and saying, 
&ldquo;Welcome, Cogia Efendy,&rdquo; with all imaginable honour 
and reverence, placed him at the head of the table, and said, 
&ldquo;Please to eat, Lord Cogia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forthwith the 
Cogia, taking hold of one of the furs of his pelisse, said, 
&ldquo;Welcome, my pelisse; please to eat, my lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The masters looking at the Cogia with great surprise, said, 
&ldquo;What are you about?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia 
replied, &ldquo;As it is quite evident that all the honour paid 
is paid to my pelisse, I think it ought to have some food 
too.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pleasantries of the Cogia

ix</span>IN DEFENCE OF BORROW.</h2>
<p>When the publishers of &ldquo;The Minerva Library&rdquo; 
invited me to write a few introductory words to this edition of 
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romany Rye,&rdquo; I hesitated at first 
about undertaking the task.&nbsp; For, notwithstanding the kind 
reception that my &ldquo;Notes upon George Borrow&rdquo; prefixed
to their edition of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; met with from the 
public and the Press, I shrank from associating again my own name
with the name of a friend who is now an English classic.&nbsp; 
But no sooner had I determined not to say any more about my 
relations with Borrow than circumstances arose that impelled me, 
as a matter of duty, to do so.&nbsp; Ever since the publication 
of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s memoirs of Borrow attacks upon his memory 
have been appearing&mdash;attacks which only those who knew him 
can repel.</p>
<p>His has indeed been a fantastic fate!&nbsp; When the 
shortcomings of any illustrious man save Borrow are under 
discussion, &ldquo;<i>les d&eacute;fauts de ses 
qualit&eacute;s</i>&rdquo; is the criticism&mdash;wise as 
charitable&mdash;which they evoke.&nbsp; Yes, each one is allowed
to have his angularities save Borrow.&nbsp; Each one is allowed 
to show his own pet unpleasant facets of character now and 
then&mdash;allowed to show them as inevitable foils to the 
pleasant ones&mdash;save Borrow.&nbsp; <i>His</i> weaknesses no 
one ever condones.&nbsp; During his lifetime his faults were for 
ever chafing and irritating his acquaintances, and now that he 
and they are all dead these faults of his seem to be chafing and 
irritating people of another generation.&nbsp; A fantastic fate, 
I say, for him who was so interesting to some of us!</p>
<p>One writer assails him on account of his own ill-judged and 
unwarrantable attacks upon a far greater man than <!-- page 
x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
x</span>himself&mdash;Sir Walter Scott; another on account of his
&ldquo;no-popery&rdquo; diatribes; another on account of his 
amusing anger over &ldquo;Charley o&rsquo;er the 
Waterism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Murray&rsquo;s new and admirable edition of 
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; came out this year, a review of the 
book appeared in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, in which vitality 
was given&mdash;given by one of the most genial as well as 
brilliant and picturesque writers of our time&mdash;to all the 
old misrepresentations of Borrow and also to a good many new 
ones.&nbsp; The fact that this review came from so distinguished 
a writer as Dr. Jessopp lends it an importance and a permanency 
that cannot be ignored.&nbsp; To me it gave a twofold pain to 
read that review, for it was written by a man for whom I have a 
very special regard.&nbsp; I cannot claim Dr. Jessopp as a 
personal friend, but I have once or twice met him; and, 
assuredly, to spend any time in his society without being greatly
attracted by him is impossible.&nbsp; I must say that I consider 
it quite lamentable that he who can hardly himself have seen much
if anything of Borrow should have breathed the anti-Borrovian 
atmosphere of Norwich&mdash;should have been brought into contact
with people there and in Norfolk generally who did know Borrow 
and who disliked, because they did not understand, him.</p>
<p>Lest it should be supposed that in writing with such warmth I 
am unduly biassed in favour of Borrow I print here a letter I 
received concerning that same review of Dr. 
Jessopp&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is written by one who has with me 
enjoyed many a delightful walk with Borrow in Richmond 
Park&mdash;one who knew Borrow many years ago&mdash;long before I
did&mdash;Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s son&mdash;Mr. Thomas St. E. 
Hake, the author of &ldquo;Within Sound of the Weir,&rdquo; and 
other successful novels, and a well-known writer in 
<i>Chambers&rsquo;s Journal</i>.</p>

<p>My Dear Watts-Dunton,&mdash;You will remember that when I 
congratulated you upon the success of your two gypsy books I 
prophesied that now there would be a boom of the gypsies: and I 
was right it seems.&nbsp; For you will see by the enclosed 
newspaper cutting that in Surrey a regular trade is going on in 
<!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xi</span>caravans for gypsy gentlemen.&nbsp; And 
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; are 
going, I see, into lots of new editions.&nbsp; I know how this 
must gratify you.&nbsp; But I write to ask you whether you have 
seen the extremely bitter attack upon Borrow&rsquo;s memory which
has appeared in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; The writer is a
man I must surely have heard you mention with esteem&mdash;Dr. 
Jessopp.&nbsp; It is a review of Murray&rsquo;s new edition of 
&ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; In case you have not seen it 
I send you a cutting from it for you to judge for yourself. <a 
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a" 
class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
<p>Was there ever anything so unjust as this?&nbsp; As to what he
says about Borrow&rsquo;s being without animal passion, I fancy 
that the writer must have misread certain printed words of yours 
in which you say, &ldquo;Supposing Borrow to have been physically
drawn towards any woman, could she possibly have been a Romany? 
would she not rather have been of the Scandinavian 
type?&rdquo;&nbsp; But I am quite sure that, when you said this, 
you did not intend to suggest that he was &ldquo;the Narses of 
Literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to his dislike of children, I have 
heard you say how interested he used to seem in the presence of 
gypsy children, and I especially remember one anecdote of yours 
about the interest he took in a child that he thought was being 
injured by the mother&rsquo;s smoking.&nbsp; And did you not get 
that lovely anecdote about the gypsy child weeping in the 
churchyard because the poor dead gorgios could not hear the 
church chimes from something he told you?&nbsp; But I can speak 
from personal experience about his feeling towards children that 
were not gypsies.&nbsp; When our family lived at Bury St. 
Edmunds, in the fifties, my father, as you know, was one of 
Borrow&rsquo;s most intimate friends, and he was frequently at 
our house, and Borrow and my father were a good deal in 
correspondence (as Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s book shows) and my 
impression of Borrow is <!-- page xii--><a 
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>exactly the
contrary of that which it would be if he in the least resembled 
Dr. Jessopp&rsquo;s description of him.&nbsp; At that time George
was in the nursery and I was a child.&nbsp; He took a wonderfully
kind interest in us all; * * * * * * * * but the one he took most
notice of was George, chiefly because he was a very big, massive 
child.&nbsp; It was then that he playfully christened him 
&ldquo;Hales,&rdquo; because he said that the child would develop
into a second &ldquo;Norfolk giant.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will 
remember that he always addressed George by that pet name.&nbsp; 
But what do you think of Dr. Jessopp&rsquo;s saying that 
Borrow&rsquo;s voice was not that of a man?&nbsp; You yourself 
have spoken in some of your writings&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly 
remember where and when&mdash;of the &ldquo;trumpet-like 
clearness&rdquo; of Borrow&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; As to his being 
beardless and therefore the &ldquo;Narses of Literature&rdquo; it
is difficult to imagine that a man of intelligence, as I suppose 
Dr. Jessopp is, can really think virility depends upon the growth
of a man&rsquo;s whiskers, as no doubt ignorant people often 
do.&nbsp; I should have thought that a man who knew Norfolk well 
would know that it is notable for its beardless giants of great 
power.&nbsp; I really think that, as Borrow&rsquo;s most intimate
friend in his latest years (I mean after my father left 
Roehampton for Germany), it is your duty to write something and 
stand up for the dear old boy, and you are the one man now who 
can defend him and do him justice.&nbsp; I assure you that the 
last time that I ever saw him his talk was a good deal about 
yourself.&nbsp; I remember the occasion very well; it was just 
outside the Bank of England, when he was returning from one of 
those mysterious East-end expeditions that you wot of: he was 
just partially recovering from that sad accident which you have 
somewhere alluded to.&nbsp; As to Dr. Jessopp, it is clear from 
his remarks upon a friend of Borrow&rsquo;s&mdash;the Rev. Mr. 
John Gunn, of Norwich, that he never saw Borrow.&nbsp; Gunn, he 
says, was of colossal frame and must have been in his youth quite
an inch taller than Borrow.&nbsp; And then he goes on to say that
Gunn&rsquo;s arm was as big as an ordinary man&rsquo;s 
thigh.&nbsp; Now you and I and George, are specially competent to
speak of Borrow&rsquo;s physical development, for we have been 
with Borrow when at seventy years of age he would bathe in a pond
covered with thin ice.&nbsp; He then stood six feet four and his 
muscles were as fully developed as those of a young man in 
training.&nbsp; If Gunn was a more colossal man than Borrow he 
certainly ought to <!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>have been put into a show.&nbsp; 
But you should read the entire article, and I wish I had 
preserved it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours ever affectionately,<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas St. E. Hake</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I consider this an interesting document to all 
Borrovians.&nbsp; There are only two things in it which I have to
challenge.&nbsp; I infer that Mr. Hake shares the common mistake 
of supposing Borrow to have been an East Anglian.&nbsp; Not that 
this is surprising, seeing that Borrow himself shared the same 
mistake&mdash;a mistake upon which I have on a previous occasion 
remarked.&nbsp; I have said elsewhere that one might as well call
Charlotte Bront&euml; a Yorkshire woman as call Borrow an East 
Anglian.&nbsp; He was, of course, no more an East Anglian than an
Irishman born in London is an Englishman.&nbsp; He had at bottom 
no East Anglian characteristics, and this explains the Norfolk 
prejudice against him.&nbsp; He inherited nothing from Norfolk 
save his accent&mdash;unless it were that love of &ldquo;leg of 
mutton and turnips&rdquo; which Mr. Hake and I have so often seen
exemplified.&nbsp; The reason why Borrow was so misjudged in 
Norfolk was, as I have hinted above, that the racial 
characteristics of the Celt and the East Anglian clashed too 
severely.&nbsp; Yet he is a striking illustration of the way in 
which the locality that has given birth to a man influences his 
imagination throughout his life.&nbsp; His father, a Cornishman 
of a good middle-class family, had been obliged, owing to a 
youthful escapade, to leave his native place and enlist as a 
common soldier.&nbsp; Afterwards he became a recruiting officer, 
and moved about from one part of Great Britain and Ireland to 
another.&nbsp; It so chanced that while staying at East Dereham, 
in Norfolk, he met and fell in love with a lady of French 
extraction.&nbsp; Not one drop of East Anglian blood was in the 
veins of Borrow&rsquo;s father, and very little in the veins of 
his mother.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s ancestry was pure Cornish on one
side, and on the other mainly French.&nbsp; But such was the 
egotism of Borrow&mdash;perhaps I should have said, such is the 
egotism of human nature&mdash;that the fact of his having been 
born in East Anglia made him look upon that part of the world as 
the very hub of the universe.&nbsp; East Anglia, however, seems 
to have cherished a very different feeling towards Borrow.&nbsp; 
Another mistake of Mr. Hake&rsquo;s is in supposing that Borrow 
<!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xiv</span>gave me the lovely incident of the gypsy child weeping 
in the churchyard because &ldquo;the poor dead gorgios could not 
hear the church bells.&rdquo;&nbsp; As this mistake has been 
shared by others, and has appeared in print, I may as well say 
that it was a real incident in the life of a well-known Romany 
chi, from whom I have this very morning received a charming 
letter dated from &ldquo;the van in the field,&rdquo; where she 
has settled for the winter.</p>
<p>The anecdote about Borrow and the gypsy child who was, or 
seemed to be, suffering through the mother&rsquo;s excessive love
of her pipe can very appropriately be introduced here, and I am 
glad that Mr. Hake has recalled it to my mind.&nbsp; It shows not
only Borrow&rsquo;s relations to childhood, but also his 
susceptibility to those charms of womankind to which Dr. Jessopp 
thinks he was impervious.&nbsp; Borrow was fond of telling this 
story himself, in support of his anti-tobacco bias.&nbsp; 
Whenever he was told, as he sometimes was, that what brought on 
the &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; when he lived alone in the dingle, was 
the want of tobacco, this story was certain to come up.</p>
<p>One lovely morning in the late summer, just before the trees 
were clothed with what is called &ldquo;gypsy gold,&rdquo; and 
the bright green of the foliage showed scarcely a touch of 
bronze&mdash;at that very moment, indeed, when the spirits of all
the wild flowers that have left the common and the hedgerow seem 
to come back for an hour and mingle their half-forgotten perfumes
with the new breath of calamint, ground-ivy, and pimpernel, he 
and a friend were walking towards a certain camp of gryengroes 
well known to them both.&nbsp; They were bound upon a quaint 
expedition.&nbsp; Will the reader &ldquo;be surprised to 
learn&rdquo; that it was connected with Matthew Arnold and a race
in which he took a good deal of interest, the gypsies?</p>
<p>Borrow, whose attention had been only lately directed by his 
friend to &ldquo;The Scholar Gypsy,&rdquo; had declared that 
there was scarcely any latter-day poetry worth reading, and also 
that whatever the merits of Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s poem might be 
from any supposed artistic point of view, it showed that Arnold 
had no conception of the Romany temper, and that no gypsy who 
ever lived could sympathise with it, or even understand its 
motive in the least degree.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s <!-- page 
xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xv</span>friend had challenged this, contending that howsoever 
Arnold&rsquo;s classic language might soar above a gypsy&rsquo;s 
intelligence, the motive was so clearly developed that the most 
illiterate person could grasp it.&nbsp; This was why in company 
with Borrow he was now going (with a copy of Arnold&rsquo;s poems
in his pocket) to try &ldquo;The Scholar Gypsy&rdquo; upon the 
first intelligent gypsy woman they should meet at the camp: as to
gypsy men, &ldquo;they were,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;too 
prosaic to furnish a fair test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were walking along, Borrow&rsquo;s eyes, which were as
long-sighted as a gypsy&rsquo;s, perceived a white speck in a 
twisted old hawthorn bush some distance off.&nbsp; He stopped and
said: &ldquo;At first I thought that white speck in the bush was 
a piece of paper, but it&rsquo;s a magpie,&rdquo; next to the 
water-wagtail the gypsies&rsquo; most famous bird.&nbsp; On going
up to the bush they discovered a magpie crouched among the 
leaves.&nbsp; As it did not stir at their approach, 
Borrow&rsquo;s friend said to him: &ldquo;It is wounded&mdash;or 
else dying&mdash;or is it a tame bird escaped from a 
cage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawk!&rdquo; said Borrow, laconically, and turned up 
his face and gazed into the sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;The magpie is 
waiting till the hawk has caught his quarry and made his 
meal.&nbsp; I fancy he has himself been &lsquo;chivvied&rsquo; by
the hawk, as the gypsies would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, sure enough, beneath one of the silver clouds that 
specked the dazzling blue a hawk&mdash;one of the kind which 
takes its prey in the open rather than in the thick 
woodlands&mdash;was wheeling up and up, and trying its best to 
get above a poor little lark in order to stoop at and devour 
it.&nbsp; That the magpie had seen the hawk and had been a 
witness of the opening of the tragedy of the lark was evident, 
for in its dread of the common foe of all well-intentioned and 
honest birds, it had forgotten its fear of all creatures except 
the hawk.&nbsp; Man it looked upon as a protecting friend.</p>
<p>As Borrow and his friend were gazing at the bird a 
woman&rsquo;s voice at their elbows said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky to chivvy the hawk what chivvies a 
magpie.&nbsp; I shall stop here till the hawk&rsquo;s flew 
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned round, and there stood a magnificent gypsy woman, 
carrying, gypsy fashion, a weakly child that, in spite <!-- page 
xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>of
its sallow and wasted cheek, proclaimed itself to be hers.&nbsp; 
By her side stood a young gypsy girl of about seventeen years of 
age.&nbsp; She was beautiful&mdash;quite remarkably so&mdash;but 
her beauty was not of the typical Romany kind.&nbsp; It was, 
perhaps, more like the beauty of a Capri girl.</p>
<p>She was bareheaded&mdash;there was not even a gypsy 
handkerchief on her head&mdash;her hair was not plaited, and was 
not smooth and glossy like a gypsy girl&rsquo;s hair, but flowed 
thick and heavy and rippling down the back of her neck and upon 
her shoulders.&nbsp; In the tumbled tresses glittered certain 
objects, which at first sight seemed to be jewels.&nbsp; They 
were small dead dragon-flies of the crimson kind called 
&ldquo;sylphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Borrow and his friend these gypsies were well known.&nbsp; 
The woman with the child was one of the Boswells: I dare not say 
what was her connection, if any, with &ldquo;Boswell the 
Great&rdquo;&mdash;I mean Sylvester Boswell, the grammarian and 
&ldquo;well-known and popalated gipsy of Codling Gap,&rdquo; who,
on a memorable occasion, wrote so eloquently about the 
superiority of the gypsy mode of life to all others &ldquo;on the
accont of health, sweetness of air, and for enjoying the pleasure
of Nature&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this I do 
remember&mdash;that it was the very same Perpinia Boswell whose 
remarkable Christian name has lately been made the subject of 
inquiry in <i>The Guardian</i>.&nbsp; The other gypsy, the girl 
of the dragon-flies, I prefer to leave nameless here.</p>
<p>After greeting the two, Borrow looked at the weakling child 
with the deepest interest, and said, &ldquo;This chavo ought not 
to look like that&mdash;with such a mother as you, 
Perpinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with such a daddy, too,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Mike&rsquo;s stronger for a man nor even I am for a 
woman&rdquo;&mdash;a glow of wifely pride passing over her face; 
&ldquo;and as to good looks, it&rsquo;s him as is got the good 
looks, not me.&nbsp; But none on us can&rsquo;t make it out about
the chavo.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s so weak and sick he don&rsquo;t look 
as if he belonged to Boswells&rsquo; breed at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many pipes of tobacco do you smoke in a day?&rdquo;
said Borrow&rsquo;s friend, looking at the great black cutty pipe
protruding from Perpinia&rsquo;s finely cut lips, and seeming 
strangely out of place there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said she, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About as many as she can afford to buy,&rdquo; 
interrupted her companion&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; 
Mike don&rsquo;t like her a-smokin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He <!-- page 
xvii--><a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xvii</span>says it makes her look like a old Londra Irish woman 
in Common Garding Market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not smoke another pipe,&rdquo; said 
Borrow&rsquo;s friend to the mother&mdash;&ldquo;not another pipe
till the child leaves the breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Perpinia defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As 
if I could live without my pipe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy Pep a-livin&rsquo; without her baccy,&rdquo; 
laughed the girl of the dragon-flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your child can&rsquo;t live with it,&rdquo; said 
Borrow&rsquo;s friend to Perpinia.&nbsp; &ldquo;That pipe of 
yours is full of a poison called nicotine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick what?&rdquo; said the girl, laughing.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new kind o&rsquo; Nick.&nbsp; Why, you 
smoke yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicotine,&rdquo; said Borrow&rsquo;s friend; &ldquo;and
the first part of Pep&rsquo;s body that the poison gets into is 
her breast, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gets into my burk?&rdquo; said Perpinia; &ldquo;get 
along wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it pison Pep&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; said Perpinia; 
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> true,&rdquo; said Borrow&rsquo;s 
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give up that pipe for a 
time the child will die, or else be a rickety thing all his 
life.&nbsp; If you <i>do</i> give it up, it will grow up to be as
fine a Romany chal as Mike himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chavo agin pipe, Pep,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me your pipe, Perpinia,&rdquo; said Borrow, in 
that hail-fellow-well-met tone of his which he reserved for the 
Romanies&mdash;a tone which no Romany could ever resist.&nbsp; 
And he took it gently from the woman&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke any more till I come to the camp and see
the chavo again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked very angry at first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be&rsquo;s a good friend to the Romanies,&rdquo; 
said the girl in an appeasing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but 
he&rsquo;s no business to take my pipe out o&rsquo; my mouth for 
all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She soon began to smile again, however, and let Borrow retain 
the pipe.&nbsp; Borrow and his friend then moved away towards the
dusty high-road leading to the camp, and were joined by the young
girl.&nbsp; Perpinia remained, keeping guard over the magpie that
was to bring luck to the sinking child.</p>
<p>It was determined now that the young girl was the very <!-- 
page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xviii</span>person to be used as the test-critic of the Romany 
mind upon Arnold&rsquo;s poem, for she was exceptionally 
intelligent.&nbsp; So instead of going to the camp the oddly 
assorted little party of three struck across the ferns, gorse, 
and heather towards &ldquo;Kingfisher brook,&rdquo; and when they
reached it they sat down on a fallen tree.</p>
<p>Nothing delights a gypsy girl so much as to listen to a story 
either told or read to her, and when Borrow&rsquo;s friend pulled
his book from his pocket the gypsy girl began to clap her 
hands.&nbsp; Her anticipation of enjoyment sent over her face a 
warm glow, and I can assure Dr. Jessopp that Borrow 
(notwithstanding that his admiration of women was confined as a 
rule to blondes of the Isopel Berners type) seemed as much struck
by her beauty as ever the Doctor could be himself.&nbsp; To say 
the truth, he frequently talked of it afterwards.&nbsp; Her 
complexion, though darker than an English girl&rsquo;s, was 
rather lighter than any ordinary gypsy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her eyes 
were of an indescribable hue, but an artist who has since then 
painted her portrait for Borrow&rsquo;s friend described it as a 
mingling of pansy-purple and dark tawny.&nbsp; The pupils were so
large that, being set in the somewhat almond-shaped and 
long-eyelashed lids of her race, they were partly curtained both 
above and below, and this had the peculiar effect of making the 
eyes seem always a little contracted and just about to 
smile.&nbsp; The great size and deep richness of the eyes made 
the straight little nose seem smaller than it really was, they 
also lessened the apparent size of the mouth, which, red as a 
rosebud, looked quite small until she laughed when the white 
teeth made quite a wide glitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of that girl,&rdquo; murmured Borrow, 
&ldquo;is really quite&mdash;quite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the sentence would have been had it 
been finished.</p>
<p>Before three lines of the poem had been read she jumped up and
cried, &ldquo;Look at the Devil&rsquo;s needles.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;re come to sew my eyes up for killing their 
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And surely enough a gigantic dragon-fly, whose body-armour of 
sky-blue and jet black, and great lace-woven wings, shining like 
a rainbow gauze, caught the sun as he swept dazzling by, did 
really seem to be attracted either by the <!-- page xix--><a 
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>wings of 
his dead brothers or by the lights shed from the girl&rsquo;s 
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dussn&rsquo;t set here,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Us Romanies call this &lsquo;Dragon-fly 
brook.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the king o&rsquo; the 
dragon-flies: he lives here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she rose she seemed to be surrounded by dragon-flies of 
about a dozen different species of all sizes, some crimson, some 
bronze, some green and gold, whirling and dancing round her as if
they meant to justify their Romany name and sew up the 
girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Romanies call them the Devil&rsquo;s 
needles,&rdquo; said Borrow; &ldquo;their business is to sew up 
pretty girl&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a second, however, they all vanished, and the girl after a 
while sat down again to listen to the &ldquo;lil,&rdquo; as she 
called the story.</p>
<p>Glanville&rsquo;s prose story, upon which Arnold&rsquo;s poem 
is based, was read first.&nbsp; In this the girl was much 
interested.&nbsp; She herself was in love with a Romany 
Rye.&nbsp; But when the reader went on to read to her 
Arnold&rsquo;s poem, though her eyes flashed now and then at the 
lovely bits of description&mdash;for the country about Oxford is 
quite remarkably like the country in which she was born&mdash;she
looked sadly bewildered, and then asked to have it all read 
again.&nbsp; After a second reading she said in a meditative way,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make out what the lil&rsquo;s all 
about&mdash;seems all about nothink!&nbsp; Seems to me that the 
pretty sights what makes a Romany fit to jump out o&rsquo; her 
skin for joy makes this &rsquo;ere gorgio want to cry.&nbsp; What
a rum lot gorgios is sure<i>ly</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she sprang up and ran off towards the camp with the 
agility of a greyhound, turning round every few moments, 
pirouetting and laughing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of that girl,&rdquo; Borrow again murmured, 
&ldquo;is quite&mdash;quite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he did not finish his sentence, but after a while 
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all true about the nicotine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly, I think,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;but not
being a medical man I must not be too emphatic.&nbsp; If it 
<i>is</i> true it ought to be a criminal offence for any woman to
smoke in excess while she is suckling a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it ought to be a criminal offence for a woman to 
smoke at all,&rdquo; growled Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy kissing a
woman&rsquo;s mouth that smelt of stale 
tobacco&mdash;pheugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
xx</span>Now, so far from forgetting this incident, Borrow took 
quite as much interest in the case as though the child had been 
his own.&nbsp; He went at short intervals to the camp to see 
Perpinia, who had abandoned her pipe, for the time being.&nbsp; 
And when after a fortnight the child, either from 
Perpinia&rsquo;s temporary abstention from nicotine, or through 
the &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; sent by the magpie, or from some 
other cause began to recover from its illness, he reported 
progress with the greatest gusto to his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not Perpinia very grateful to you and to me?&rdquo; 
said the friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Borrow, with a twinkle in his 
eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;She manages to feel grateful to you and me for 
making her give up the pipe, and also to believe at the same time
that her child was saved by the good luck that came to her 
because she guarded the magpie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it were needful to furnish other instances of 
Borrow&rsquo;s interest in children, and also of his 
susceptibility to feminine charms, I could easily furnish 
them.&nbsp; As to the &ldquo;rancorous hatred that smouldered in 
that sad heart of his,&rdquo; in spite of all his oddities, all 
his &ldquo;cantankerousness,&rdquo; to use one of his own words, 
he was a singularly steadfast and loyal friend.&nbsp; Indeed, it 
was the very steadfastness of his friendship that drove him to 
perpetrate that outrage at Mr. Bevan&rsquo;s house, recorded in 
Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need only 
recall the way in which he used to speak of those who had been 
kind to him (such as his publisher, Mr. John Murray for instance)
to show that no one could be more loyal or more grateful than he 
who has been depicted as the incarnation of all that is spiteful,
fussy, and mean.&nbsp; There is no need for the world to be told 
here that the author of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is a delightful 
writer, and one who is more sure than most authors of his time to
win that little span of life which writing men call 
&ldquo;immortality.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if there is need for the 
world to be told further that George Borrow was a good man, that 
he was a most winsome and a most charming companion, that he was 
an English gentleman, straightforward, honest, and brave as the 
very best exemplars of that fine old type, the world is now told 
so&mdash;told so by two of the few living men who can speak of 
him with authority, the writer of the above letter and 
myself.</p>

<p>THE MAKING OF THE LINCH-PIN&mdash;THE SOUND 
SLEEPER&mdash;BREAKFAST&mdash;THE POSTILLION&rsquo;S 
DEPARTURE.</p>
<p>I awoke at the first break of day, and, leaving the postillion
fast asleep, stepped out of the tent.&nbsp; The dingle was dank 
and dripping.&nbsp; I lighted a fire of coals, and got my forge 
in readiness.&nbsp; I then ascended to the field, where the 
chaise was standing as we had left it on the previous 
evening.&nbsp; After looking at the cloud-stone near it, now 
cold, and split into three pieces, I set about prying narrowly 
into the condition of the wheel and axle-tree&mdash;the latter 
had sustained no damage of any consequence, and the wheel, as far
as I was able to judge, was sound, being only slightly injured in
the box.&nbsp; The only thing requisite to set the chaise in a 
travelling condition appeared to be a linch-pin, which I 
determined to make.&nbsp; Going to the companion wheel, I took 
out the linch-pin, which I carried down with me to the dingle, to
serve me as a model.</p>
<p>I found Belle by this time dressed, and seated near the forge:
with a slight nod to her like that which a person gives who 
happens to see an acquaintance when his mind is occupied with 
important business, I forthwith set about my work.&nbsp; 
Selecting a piece of iron which I thought would serve my purpose,
I placed it in the fire, and plying the bellows in a furious 
manner, soon made it hot; then seizing it with the tongs, I laid 
it on my anvil, and began to beat it with my hammer, according to
the rules of my art.&nbsp; The dingle resounded with my 
strokes.&nbsp; Belle sat still, and occasionally smiled, but <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>suddenly started up and retreated towards her encampment,
on a spark which I purposely sent in her direction alighting on 
her knee.&nbsp; I found the making of a linch-pin no easy matter;
it was, however, less difficult than the fabrication of a 
pony-shoe; my work, indeed, was much facilitated by my having 
another pin to look at.&nbsp; In about three-quarters of an hour 
I had succeeded tolerably well, and had produced a linch-pin 
which I thought would serve.&nbsp; During all this time, 
notwithstanding the noise which I was making, the postillion 
never showed his face.&nbsp; His non-appearance at first alarmed 
me: I was afraid he might be dead, but, on looking into the tent,
I found him still buried in the soundest sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;He 
must surely be descended from one of the seven sleepers,&rdquo; 
said I, as I turned away and resumed my work.&nbsp; My work 
finished, I took a little oil, leather, and sand, and polished 
the pin as well as I could; then, summoning Belle, we both went 
to the chaise, where, with her assistance, I put on the 
wheel.&nbsp; The linch-pin which I had made fitted its place very
well, and having replaced the other, I gazed at the chaise for 
some time with my heart full of that satisfaction which results 
from the consciousness of having achieved a great action; then, 
after looking at Belle in the hope of obtaining a compliment from
her lips, which did not come, I returned to the dingle, without 
saying a word, followed by her.&nbsp; Belle set about making 
preparations for breakfast; and I, taking the kettle, went and 
filled it at the spring.&nbsp; Having hung it over the fire, I 
went to the tent in which the postillion was still sleeping, and 
called upon him to arise.&nbsp; He awoke with a start, and stared
around him at first with the utmost surprise, not unmixed, I 
could observe, with a certain degree of fear.&nbsp; At last, 
looking in my face, he appeared to recollect himself.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I had quite forgot,&rdquo; said he, as he got up, 
&ldquo;where I was, and all that happened yesterday.&nbsp; 
However, I remember now the whole affair, thunder-storm, 
thunder-bolt, frightened horses, and all your kindness.&nbsp; 
Come, I must see after my coach and horses; I hope we shall be 
able to repair the damage.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The damage is 
already quite repaired,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as you will see, if
you come to the field above.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t 
say so,&rdquo; said the postillion, coming out of the tent; 
&ldquo;well, I am mightily beholden to you.&nbsp; Good morning, 
young gentlewoman,&rdquo; said he, addressing Belle, who, having 
finished her preparations, was seated near the fire.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Good morning, young man,&rdquo; said Belle: &ldquo;I 
suppose you would <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>be glad of some breakfast; however, 
you must wait a little, the kettle does not boil.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Come and look at your chaise,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but 
tell me how it happened that the noise which I have been making 
did not awake you; for three-quarters of an hour at least I was 
hammering close at your ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard you all 
the time,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;but your hammering 
made me sleep all the sounder; I am used to hear hammering in my 
morning sleep.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a forge close by the room 
where I sleep when I&rsquo;m at home, at my inn; for we have all 
kinds of conveniences at my inn&mdash;forge, carpenter&rsquo;s 
shop, and wheelwright&rsquo;s,&mdash;so that when I heard you 
hammering, I thought, no doubt, that it was the old noise, and 
that I was comfortable in my bed at my own inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; We 
now ascended to the field, where I showed the postillion his 
chaise.&nbsp; He looked at the pin attentively, rubbed his hands,
and gave a loud laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not well done?&rdquo; 
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will do till I get home,&rdquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that is all you have to say?&rdquo; I 
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a good deal,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;considering who made it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But 
don&rsquo;t be offended,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall prize it
all the more for its being made by a gentleman, and no 
blacksmith; and so will my governor, when I show it to him.&nbsp;
I shan&rsquo;t let it remain where it is, but will keep it as a 
remembrance of you, as long as I live.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then again
rubbed his hands with great glee, and said, &ldquo;I will now go 
and see after my horses, and then to breakfast, partner, if you 
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly, however, looking at his hands, he 
said, &ldquo;Before sitting down to breakfast, I am in the habit 
of washing my hands and face: I suppose you could not furnish me 
with a little soap and water.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As much water 
as you please,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but if you want soap, I must
go and trouble the young gentlewoman for some.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;water will
do at a pinch.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said I; and 
leading him to the pond of the frogs and newts, I said, 
&ldquo;This is my ewer; you are welcome to part of it&mdash;the 
water is so soft that it is scarcely necessary to add soap to 
it;&rdquo; then lying down on the bank, I plunged my head into 
the water, then scrubbed my hands and face, and afterwards wiped 
them with some long grass which grew on the margin of the 
pond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I 
see you know how to make a shift;&rdquo; he then followed my 
example, declared he never felt more refreshed in his life, and, 
giving a bound, said &ldquo;he would go and look after his 
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>We then went to look after the horses, which we found not
much the worse for having spent the night in the open air.&nbsp; 
My companion again inserted their heads in the corn-bags, and, 
leaving the animals to discuss their corn, returned with me to 
the dingle, where we found the kettle boiling.&nbsp; We sat down,
and Belle made tea and did the honours of the meal.&nbsp; The 
postillion was in high spirits, ate heartily, and, to 
Belle&rsquo;s evident satisfaction, declared that he had never 
drank better tea in his life, or indeed any half so good.&nbsp; 
Breakfast over, he said that he must now go and harness his 
horses, as it was high time for him to return to his inn.&nbsp; 
Belle gave him her hand and wished him farewell: the postillion 
shook her hand warmly, and was advancing close up to 
her&mdash;for what purpose I cannot say&mdash;whereupon Belle, 
withdrawing her hand, drew herself up with an air which caused 
the postillion to retreat a step or two with an exceedingly 
sheepish look.&nbsp; Recovering himself, however, he made a low 
bow, and proceeded up the path.&nbsp; I attended him, and helped 
to harness his horses and put them to the vehicle; he then shook 
me by the hand, and taking the reins and whip mounted to his 
seat; ere he drove away he thus addressed me: &ldquo;If ever I 
forget your kindness and that of the young woman below, dash my 
buttons.&nbsp; If ever either of you should enter my inn you may 
depend upon a warm welcome, the best that can be set before you, 
and no expense to either, for I will give both of you the best of
characters to the governor, who is the very best fellow upon all 
the road.&nbsp; As for your linch-pin, I trust it will serve till
I get home, when I will take it out and keep it in remembrance of
you all the days of my life:&rdquo; then giving the horses a jerk
with his reins, he cracked his whip and drove off.</p>
<p>I returned to the dingle, Belle had removed the breakfast 
things, and was busy in her own encampment: nothing occurred, 
worthy of being related, for two hours, at the end of which time 
Belle departed on a short expedition, and I again found myself 
alone in the dingle.</p>

<p>THE MAN IN BLACK&mdash;THE EMPEROR OF 
GERMANY&mdash;NEPOTISM&mdash;DONNA 
OLYMPIA&mdash;OMNIPOTENCE&mdash;CAMILLO ASTALLI&mdash;THE FIVE 
PROPOSITIONS.</p>
<p>In the evening I received another visit from the man in 
black.&nbsp; I had been taking a stroll in the neighbourhood, and
was sitting in the dingle in rather a listless manner, scarcely 
knowing how to employ myself; his coming, therefore, was by no 
means disagreeable to me.&nbsp; I produced the hollands and glass
from my tent, where Isopel Berners had requested me to deposit 
them, and also some lump sugar, then taking the gotch I fetched 
water from the spring, and, sitting down, begged the man in black
to help himself; he was not slow in complying with my desire, and
prepared for himself a glass of Hollands and water with a lump of
sugar in it.&nbsp; After he had taken two or three sips with 
evident satisfaction, I, remembering his chuckling exclamation of
&ldquo;Go to Rome for money,&rdquo; when he last left the dingle,
took the liberty, after a little conversation, of reminding him 
of it, whereupon, with a he! he! he! he replied, &ldquo;Your idea
was not quite so original as I supposed.&nbsp; After leaving you 
the other night I remembered having read of an emperor of Germany
who conceived the idea of applying to Rome for money, and 
actually put it into practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urban the Eighth then occupied the papal chair, of the 
family of the Barbarini, nicknamed the Mosche, or Flies, from the
circumstance of bees being their armorial bearing.&nbsp; The 
Emperor having exhausted all his money in endeavouring to defend 
the church against Gustavus Adolphus, the great King of Sweden, 
who was bent on its destruction, applied in his necessity to the 
Pope for a loan of money.&nbsp; The Pope, however, and his 
relations, whose cellars were at that time full of the money of 
the church, which they had been plundering for years, refused to 
lend him a scudo; whereupon a pasquinade picture was stuck up at 
Rome, representing the church lying on a bed, gashed with 
dreadful wounds, and beset all over with flies, which were 
sucking her, whilst the Emperor of Germany was kneeling before 
her with a miserable face, requesting a little money towards 
carrying on the war against the heretics, to which the poor 
church was made to say: &lsquo;How can I assist <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>you, O my 
champion, do you not see that the flies have sucked me to the 
very bones?&rsquo;&nbsp; Which story,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;shows that the idea of going to Rome for money was not 
quite so original as I imagined the other night, though utterly 
preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This affair,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;occurred in what 
were called the days of nepotism.&nbsp; Certain popes, who wished
to make themselves in some degree independent of the cardinals, 
surrounded themselves with their nephews, and the rest of their 
family, who sucked the church and Christendom as much as they 
could, none doing so more effectually than the relations of Urban
the Eighth, at whose death, according to the book called the 
&lsquo;Nipotismo di Roma,&rsquo; there were in the Barbarini 
family two hundred and twenty-seven governments, abbeys, and high
dignities; and so much hard cash in their possession that 
threescore and ten mules were scarcely sufficient to convey the 
plunder of one of them to Palestrina.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added, 
however, that it was probable that Christendom fared better 
whilst the popes were thus independent, as it was less sucked, 
whereas before and after that period, it was sucked by hundreds 
instead of tens, by the cardinals and all their relations, 
instead of by the pope and his nephews only.</p>
<p>Then, after drinking rather copiously of his hollands, he said
that it was certainly no bad idea of the popes to surround 
themselves with nephews, on whom they bestowed great church 
dignities, as by so doing they were tolerably safe from poison, 
whereas a pope, if abandoned to the cardinals, might at any time 
be made away with by them, provided they thought that he lived 
too long, or that he seemed disposed to do anything which they 
disliked; adding, that Ganganelli would never have been poisoned 
provided he had had nephews about him to take care of his life, 
and to see that nothing unholy was put into his food, or a 
bustling stirring brother&rsquo;s wife like Donna Olympia.&nbsp; 
He then with a he! he! he! asked me if I had ever read the book 
called the &ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma;&rdquo; and on my replying in
the negative, he told me that it was a very curious and 
entertaining book, which he occasionally looked at in an idle 
hour, and proceeded to relate to me anecdotes out of the 
&ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma&rdquo; about the successor of Urban, 
Innocent the Tenth, and Donna Olympia, showing how fond he was of
her, and how she cooked his food, and kept the cardinals away 
from it, and how she and her creatures plundered Christendom, 
with the sanction of the Pope, until Christendom, becoming 
enraged, <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>insisted that he should put her away, 
which he did for a time, putting a nephew&mdash;one Camillo 
Astalli&mdash;in her place, in which, however, he did not 
continue long; for the Pope conceiving a pique against him, 
banished him from his sight, and recalled Donna Olympia, who took
care of his food, and plundered Christendom until Pope Innocent 
died.</p>
<p>I said that I only wondered that between pope and cardinals 
the whole system of Rome had not long fallen to the ground, and 
was told in reply, that its not having fallen was the strongest 
proof of its vital power, and the absolute necessity for the 
existence of the system.&nbsp; That the system, notwithstanding 
its occasional disorders, went on.&nbsp; Popes and cardinals 
might prey upon its bowels, and sell its interests, but the 
system survived.&nbsp; The cutting off of this or that member was
not able to cause Rome any vital loss; for, as soon as she lost a
member, the loss was supplied by her own inherent vitality; 
though her popes had been poisoned by cardinals, and her 
cardinals by popes; and though priests occasionally poisoned 
popes, cardinals, and each other, after all that had been, and 
might be, she had still, and would ever have, her priests, 
cardinals, and pope.</p>
<p>Finding the man in black so communicative and reasonable, I 
determined to make the best of my opportunity, and learn from him
all I could with respect to the papal system, and told him that 
he would particularly oblige me by telling me who the Pope of 
Rome was; and received for answer, that he was an old man elected
by a majority of cardinals to the papal chair; who, immediately 
after his election, became omnipotent and equal to God on 
earth.&nbsp; On my begging him not to talk such nonsense, and 
asking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always 
preserve himself from poison, even when fenced round by nephews, 
or protected by a bustling woman, he, after taking a long sip of 
hollands and water, told me that I must not expect too much from 
omnipotence; for example, that as it would be unreasonable to 
expect that One above could annihilate the past&mdash;for 
instance, the Seven Years&rsquo; War, or the French 
Revolution&mdash;though any one who believed in Him would 
acknowledge Him to be omnipotent, so would it be unreasonable for
the faithful to expect that the Pope could always guard himself 
from poison.&nbsp; Then, after looking at me for a moment 
steadfastly, and taking another sip, he told me that popes had 
frequently done impossibilities; for example, Innocent the Tenth 
had created a nephew: for, not liking particularly any of <!-- 
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>his
real nephews, he had created the said Camillo Astalli his nephew;
asking me, with a he! he! &ldquo;What but omnipotence could make 
a young man nephew to a person to whom he was not in the 
slightest degree related?&rdquo;&nbsp; On my observing that of 
course no one believed that the young fellow was really the 
pope&rsquo;s nephew, though the pope might have adopted him as 
such, the man in black replied, &ldquo;that the reality of the 
nephewship of Camillo Astalli had hitherto never become a point 
of faith; let, however, the present pope, or any other pope, 
proclaim that it is necessary to believe in the reality of the 
nephewship of Camillo Astalli, and see whether the faithful would
not believe in it.&nbsp; Who can doubt that,&rdquo; he added, 
&ldquo;seeing that they believe in the reality of the five 
propositions of Jansenius?&nbsp; The Jesuits, wishing to ruin the
Jansenists, induced a pope to declare that such and such damnable
opinions, which they called five propositions, were to be found 
in a book written by Jansen, though in reality no such 
propositions were to be found there; whereupon the existence of 
these propositions became forthwith a point of faith to the 
faithful.&nbsp; Do you then think,&rdquo; he demanded, 
&ldquo;that there is one of the faithful who would not swallow, 
if called upon, the nephewship of Camillo Astalli as easily as 
the five propositions of Jansenius?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely, 
then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the faithful must be a pretty pack of
simpletons!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the man in black exclaimed, 
&ldquo;What! a Protestant, and an infringer of the rights of 
faith!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a fellow, who would feel himself 
insulted if any one were to ask him how he could believe in the 
miraculous conception, calling people simpletons who swallow the 
five propositions of Jansenius, and are disposed, if called upon,
to swallow the reality of the nephewship of Camillo 
Astalli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to speak, when I was interrupted by the arrival of
Belle.&nbsp; After unharnessing her donkey, and adjusting her 
person a little, she came and sat down by us.&nbsp; In the 
meantime I had helped my companion to some more hollands and 
water, and had plunged with him into yet deeper discourse.</p>

<p>NECESSITY OF RELIGION&mdash;THE GREAT INDIAN 
ONE&mdash;IMAGE-WORSHIP&mdash;SHAKESPEAR&mdash;THE PAT 
ANSWER&mdash;KRISHNA&mdash;AMEN.</p>
<p>Having told the man in black that I should like to know all 
the truth with regard to the Pope and his system, he assured me 
he should be delighted to give me all the information in his 
power; that he had come to the dingle, not so much for the sake 
of the good cheer which I was in the habit of giving him, as in 
the hope of inducing me to enlist under the banners of Rome, and 
to fight in her cause; and that he had no doubt that, by speaking
out frankly to me, he ran the best chance of winning me over.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless 
ages had proved the necessity of religion; the necessity, he 
would admit, was only for simpletons; but as nine-tenths of the 
dwellers upon this earth were simpletons, it would never do for 
sensible people to run counter to their folly, but, on the 
contrary, it was their wisest course to encourage them in it, 
always provided that, by so doing, sensible people could derive 
advantage; that the truly sensible people of this world were the 
priests, who, without caring a straw for religion for its own 
sake, made use of it as a cord by which to draw the simpletons 
after them; that there were many religions in this world, all of 
which had been turned to excellent account by the priesthood; but
that the one the best adapted for the purposes of priestcraft was
the popish, which, he said, was the oldest in the world and the 
best calculated to endure.&nbsp; On my inquiring what he meant by
saying the popish religion was the oldest in the world, whereas 
there could be no doubt that the Greek and Roman religion had 
existed long before it, to say nothing of the old Indian religion
still in existence and vigour; he said, with a nod, after taking 
a sip at his glass, that, between me and him, the popish 
religion, that of Greece and Rome, and the old Indian system 
were, in reality, one and the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that you intended to be frank,&rdquo; said 
I; &ldquo;but, however frank you may be, I think you are rather 
wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We priests of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, 
&ldquo;even those <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>amongst us who do not go much abroad,
know a great deal about church matters, of which you heretics 
have very little idea.&nbsp; Those of our brethren of the 
Propaganda, on their return home from distant missions, not 
unfrequently tell us very strange things relating to our dear 
mother; for example, our first missionaries to the East were not 
slow in discovering and telling to their brethren that our 
religion and the great Indian one were identical, no more 
difference between them than between Ram and Rome.&nbsp; Priests,
convents, beads, prayers, processions, fastings, penances, all 
the same, not forgetting anchorites and vermin, he! he!&nbsp; The
pope they found under the title of the grand lama, a sucking 
child surrounded by an immense number of priests.&nbsp; Our good 
brethren, some two hundred years ago, had a hearty laugh, which 
their successors have often re-echoed; they said that helpless 
suckling and its priests put them so much in mind of their own 
old man, surrounded by his cardinals, he! he!&nbsp; Old age is 
second childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they find Christ?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found him too,&rdquo; said the man in black, 
&ldquo;that is, they saw his image; he is considered in India as 
a pure kind of being, and on that account, perhaps, is kept there
rather in the background, even as he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this is very mysterious to me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but 
of this I am tolerably sure, and so are most of those of Rome, 
that modern Rome had its religion from ancient Rome, which had 
its religion from the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brought about, I believe, by the wanderings of 
nations,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A brother of 
the Propaganda, a very learned man, once told me&mdash;I do not 
mean Mezzofanti, who has not five ideas&mdash;this brother once 
told me that all we of the Old World, from Calcutta to Dublin, 
are of the same stock, and were originally of the same language, 
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of one religion,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of one religion,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;and now follow different modifications of the same 
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Christians are not image-worshippers,&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heretics are not, you mean,&rdquo; said the man in 
black; &ldquo;but you will be put down, just as you have always 
been, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>though others may rise up after you; 
the true religion is image-worship; people may strive against it,
but they will only work themselves to an oil; how did it fare 
with that Greek Emperor, the Iconoclast, what was his name, Leon 
the Isaurian?&nbsp; Did not his image-breaking cost him Italy, 
the fairest province of his empire, and did not ten fresh images 
start up at home for every one which he demolished?&nbsp; Oh! you
little know the craving which the soul sometimes feels after a 
good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed no conception of it,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;I have an abhorrence of idolatry&mdash;the idea of bowing 
before a graven figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, who had now joined
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never bow before that of Shakespear?&rdquo; 
said the man in black, addressing himself to me, after a low bow 
to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever did,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;but even suppose I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you did,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;shame on you, Mr. Hater of Idolatry; why, the very 
supposition brings you to the ground; you must make figures of 
Shakespear, must you? then why not of St. Antonio, or Ignacio, or
of a greater personage still?&nbsp; I know what you are going to 
say,&rdquo; he cried, interrupting me as I was about to 
speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make his image in order to 
pay it divine honours, but only to look at it, and think of 
Shakespear; but this looking at a thing in order to think of a 
person is the very basis of idolatry.&nbsp; Shakespear&rsquo;s 
works are not sufficient for you; no more are the Bible or the 
legend of Saint Anthony or Saint Ignacio for us that is for those
of us, who believe in them; I tell you, Zingaro, that no religion
can exist long which rejects a good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that 
Shakespear&rsquo;s works would not exist without his 
image?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;that 
Shakespear&rsquo;s image is looked at more than his works, and 
will be looked at, and perhaps adored, when they are 
forgotten.&nbsp; I am surprised that they have not been forgotten
long ago; I am no admirer of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how 
you will put aside the authority of Moses.&nbsp; If Moses strove 
against image-worship, should not his doing so be conclusive as 
to the impropriety of <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the practice; what higher authority 
can you have than that of Moses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The practice of the great majority of the human 
race,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and the recurrence to 
image-worship, where image-worship has been abolished.&nbsp; Do 
you know that Moses is considered by the church as no better than
a heretic, and though, for particular reasons, it has been 
obliged to adopt his writings, the adoption was merely a sham 
one, as it never paid the slightest attention to them?&nbsp; No, 
no, the church was never led by Moses, nor by one mightier than 
he, whose doctrine it has equally nullified&mdash;I allude to 
Krishna in his second avatar; the church, it is true, governs in 
his name, but not unfrequently gives him the lie, if he happens 
to have said anything which it dislikes.&nbsp; Did you never hear
the reply which Padre Paolo Segani made to the French Protestant 
Jean Anthoine Guerin, who had asked him whether it was easier for
Christ to have been mistaken in his Gospel, than for the Pope to 
be mistaken in his decrees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard their names before,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was pat,&rdquo; said the man in black, 
&ldquo;though he who made it was confessedly the most ignorant 
fellow of the very ignorant order to which he belonged, the 
Augustine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ might err as a man,&rsquo; said 
he, &lsquo;but the Pope can never err, being God.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The whole story is related in the Nipotismo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you should ever have troubled yourselves with 
Christ at all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was to be done?&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;the power of that name suddenly came over Europe, like the
power of a mighty wind; it was said to have come from 
Jud&aelig;a, and from Jud&aelig;a it probably came when it first 
began to agitate minds in these parts; but it seems to have been 
known in the remote East, more or less, for thousands of years 
previously.&nbsp; It filled people&rsquo;s minds with madness; it
was followed by books which were never much regarded, as they 
contained little of insanity; but the name! what fury that 
breathed into people! the books were about peace and gentleness, 
but the name was the most horrible of war-cries&mdash;those who 
wished to uphold old names at first strove to oppose it, but 
their efforts were feeble, and they had no good war-cry; what was
Mars as a war-cry compared with the name of . . .?&nbsp; It was 
said that they persecuted terribly, but who said so?&nbsp; The 
Christians.&nbsp; The Christians could have given them a lesson 
in the art of persecution, <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and 
eventually did so.&nbsp; None but Christians have ever been good 
persecutors; well, the old religion succumbed, Christianity 
prevailed, for the ferocious is sure to prevail over the 
gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you stated a little 
time ago that the Popish religion and the ancient Roman are the 
same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every point but that name, that Krishna and the fury
and love of persecution which it inspired,&rdquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A hot blast came from the East, sounding 
Krishna; it absolutely maddened people&rsquo;s minds, and the 
people would call themselves his children; we will not belong to 
Jupiter any longer, we will belong to Krishna; and they did 
belong to Krishna, that is in name, but in nothing else; for who 
ever cared for Krishna in the Christian world, or who ever 
regarded the words attributed to Him, or put them in 
practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we Protestants regard his words, and endeavour to 
practise what they enjoin as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you reject his image,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;better reject his words than his image: no religion can 
exist long which rejects a good bodily image.&nbsp; Why, the very
negro barbarians of High Barbary could give you a lesson on that 
point; they have their fetish images, to which they look for help
in their afflictions; they have likewise a high priest, whom they
call . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumbo Jumbo,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I know all about him
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came you to know anything about him?&rdquo; said 
the man in black, with a look of some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us poor Protestant tinkers,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;though we live in dingles, are also acquainted with a 
thing or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe you are,&rdquo; said the man in black,
staring at me; &ldquo;but, in connection with this Mumbo Jumbo, I
could relate to you a comical story about a fellow, an English 
servant, I once met at Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be quite unnecessary,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I 
would much sooner hear you talk about Krishna, his words and 
image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true heretic,&rdquo; said the man in 
black; &ldquo;one of the faithful would have placed his image 
before his words; for what are all the words in the world 
compared with a good bodily image?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you occasionally quote his words?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;upon this rock I 
will found my church.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;you 
must really become one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the 
rock to Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;faith can remove mountains, to say nothing of 
rocks&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what 
advantage you could derive from perverting those words of 
Scripture in which the Saviour talks about eating his 
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, indeed, why we troubled our heads about 
the matter at all,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but when 
you talk about perverting the meaning of the text, you speak 
ignorantly, Mr. Tinker; when he whom you call the Saviour gave 
his followers the sop, and bade them eat it, telling them it was 
his body, he delicately alluded to what it was incumbent upon 
them to do after his death, namely, to eat his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say that he intended they should 
actually eat his body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you suppose ignorantly,&rdquo; said the man in 
black; &ldquo;eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish 
custom, practised by the heirs and legatees of people who left 
property; and this custom is alluded to in the text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has the New Testament to do with heathen 
customs,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;except to destroy them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you suppose,&rdquo; said the man in 
black.&nbsp; &ldquo;We priests of Rome, who have long lived at 
Rome, know much better what the New Testament is made of than the
heretics and their theologians, not forgetting their Tinkers; 
though I confess some of the latter have occasionally surprised 
us&mdash;for example, Bunyan.&nbsp; The New Testament is crowded 
with allusions to heathen customs, and with words connected with 
pagan sorcery.&nbsp; Now, with respect to words, I would fain 
have you, who pretend to be a philologist, tell me the meaning of
Amen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;know 
two or three things of which the heretics are quite ignorant; for
example, there are those amongst us&mdash;those, too, who do not 
pretend to be philologists&mdash;who know what amen is, and, 
moreover, how we got it.&nbsp; We got it from our ancestors, the 
priests of ancient Rome; and they got the word from their 
ancestors of the East, the priests of Buddh and 
Brahma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the meaning of the word?&rdquo; I 
demanded.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a 
modification of the old Hindoo formula, Omani batsikhom, by the 
almost ceaseless repetition of which the Indians hope to be 
received finally to the rest or state of forgetfulness of Buddh 
or Brahma; a foolish practice you will say, but are you heretics 
much wiser, who are continually sticking amen to the end of your 
prayers little knowing when you do so, that you are consigning 
yourselves to the repose of Buddh?&nbsp; Oh, what hearty laughs 
our missionaries have had when comparing the eternally sounding 
Eastern gibberish of Omani batsikhom, Omani batsikhom, and the 
Ave Maria and Amen Jesus of our own idiotical 
devotees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say about the Ave Marias and Amens of
your superstitious devotees,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I dare say 
that they use them nonsensically enough, but in putting Amen to 
the end of a prayer, we merely intend to express, &lsquo;So let 
it be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said the man in 
black; &ldquo;and the Hindoos might just as well put your 
national oath at the end of their prayers, as perhaps they will 
after a great many thousand years, when English is forgotten, and
only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without being 
understood.&nbsp; How strange if, after the lapse of four 
thousand years, the Hindoos should damn themselves to the 
blindness so dear to their present masters, even as their masters
at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the
Hindoos; but my glass has been empty for a considerable time; 
perhaps Bellissima Biondina,&rdquo; said he, addressing Belle, 
&ldquo;you will deign to replenish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;you
have drank quite enough, and talked more than enough, and to tell
you the truth I wish you would leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;consider the
obligations of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sick of that word,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you 
are so frequently misusing it; were this place not Mumpers&rsquo;
Dingle, and consequently as free to the fellow as ourselves, I 
would lead him out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be quiet, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
had better help yourself,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the
man in black, &ldquo;the lady is angry with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;if she is angry with me, I am not so with her, and shall 
always be proud to wait upon her; in the meantime I will wait 
upon myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man in black having helped himself to some more of his 
favourite beverage, and tasted it, I thus addressed him: 
&ldquo;The evening is getting rather advanced, and I can see that
this lady,&rdquo; pointing to Belle, &ldquo;is anxious for her 
tea, which she prefers to take cosily and comfortably with me in 
the dingle.&nbsp; The place, it is true, is as free to you as to 
ourselves, nevertheless, as we are located here by necessity, 
whilst you merely come as a visitor, I must take the liberty of 
telling you that we shall be glad to be alone, as soon as you 
have said what you have to say, and have finished the glass of 
refreshment at present in your hand.&nbsp; I think you said some 
time ago that one of your motives for coming hither was to induce
me to enlist under the banner of Rome.&nbsp; I wish to know 
whether that was really the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I 
come here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our 
regiment, in which I have no doubt you could do us excellent 
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you enlist my companion as well?&rdquo; I 
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be only too proud to have her among us, 
whether she comes with you or alone,&rdquo; said the man in 
black, with a polite bow to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we give you an answer,&rdquo; I replied, 
&ldquo;I would fain know more about you; perhaps you will declare
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will never do,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;no one in England knows it but myself, and I will not 
declare it, even in a dingle; as for the rest, <i>Sono un Prete 
Cattolico Appostolico</i>&mdash;that is all that many a one of us
can say for himself, and it assuredly means a great 
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now proceed to business,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You must be aware that we English are generally considered
a self-interested people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with considerable justice,&rdquo; said the man in 
black, drinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you are a person of acute 
perception, and I will presently make it evident to you that it 
would be to your interest to join with us.&nbsp; You are at 
present, evidently, in <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>very needy circumstances, and are 
lost, not only to yourself, but the world; but should you enlist 
with us, I could find you an occupation not only agreeable, but 
one in which your talents would have free scope.&nbsp; I would 
introduce you in the various grand houses here in England, to 
which I have myself admission, as a surprising young gentleman of
infinite learning, who by dint of study has discovered that the 
Roman is the only true faith.&nbsp; I tell you confidently that 
our popish females would make a saint, nay, a God of you; they 
are fools enough for anything.&nbsp; There is one person in 
particular with whom I should wish to make you acquainted, in the
hope that you would be able to help me to perform good service to
the holy see.&nbsp; He is a gouty old fellow, of some learning, 
residing in an old hall, near the great western seaport, and is 
one of the very few amongst the English Catholics possessing a 
grain of sense.&nbsp; I think you could help us to govern him, 
for he is not unfrequently disposed to be restive, asks us 
strange questions&mdash;occasionally threatens us with his 
crutch; and behaves so that we are often afraid that we shall 
lose him, or, rather, his property, which he has bequeathed to 
us, and which is enormous.&nbsp; I am sure that you could help us
to deal with him; sometimes with your humour, sometimes with your
learning, and perhaps occasionally with your fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in what manner would you provide for my 
companion?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would place her at once,&rdquo; said the man in 
black, &ldquo;in the house of two highly respectable Catholic 
ladies in this neighbourhood, where she would be treated with 
every care and consideration till her conversion should be 
accomplished in a regular manner; we would then remove her to a 
female monastic establishment, where, after undergoing a 
year&rsquo;s probation, during which time she would be instructed
in every elegant accomplishment, she should take the veil.&nbsp; 
Her advancement would speedily follow, for, with such a face and 
figure, she would make a capital lady abbess, especially in 
Italy, to which country she would probably be sent; ladies of her
hair and complexion&mdash;to say nothing of her 
height&mdash;being a curiosity in the south.&nbsp; With a little 
care and management she could soon obtain a vast reputation for 
sanctity; and who knows but after her death she might become a 
glorified saint&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Sister Maria Theresa, for 
that is the name I propose you should bear.&nbsp; Holy Mother 
Maria Theresa&mdash;glorified and celestial saint, I <!-- page 
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>have 
the honour of drinking to your health,&rdquo; and the man in 
black drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have you to say
to the gentleman&rsquo;s proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if he goes on in this way I will break his glass 
against his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the lady&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and shall 
not press the matter.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help, however, 
repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess; she would 
keep the nuns in order, I warrant her; no easy matter!&nbsp; 
Break the glass against my mouth&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; How she 
would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns&rsquo; heads 
occasionally, and just the person to wring the nose of Satan 
should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of
a handsome black man.&nbsp; No offence, madam, no offence, pray 
retain your seat,&rdquo; said he, observing that Belle had 
started up; &ldquo;I mean no offence.&nbsp; Well, if you will not
consent to be an abbess, perhaps you will consent to follow this 
young Zingaro, and to co-operate with him and us.&nbsp; I am a 
priest, madam, and can join you both in an instant, <i>connubio 
stabili</i>, as I suppose the knot has not been tied 
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your mumping gibberish,&rdquo; said Belle, 
&ldquo;and leave the dingle this moment, for though &rsquo;tis 
free to every one, you have no right to insult me in 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be pacified,&rdquo; said I to Belle, getting up, 
and placing myself between her and the man in black, &ldquo;he 
will presently leave, take my word for it&mdash;there, sit down 
again,&rdquo; said I, as I led her to her seat; then, resuming my
own, I said to the man in black: &ldquo;I advise you to leave the
dingle as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish to have your answer to my proposal 
first,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here you shall have it: I will not 
entertain your proposal; I detest your schemes: they are both 
wicked and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;have they 
not&mdash;he! he!&mdash;the furtherance of religion in 
view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A religion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in which you yourself
do not believe, and which you contemn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I believe in it or not,&rdquo; said the man in 
black, &ldquo;it is adapted for the generality of the human race;
so I will forward it, and advise you to do the same.&nbsp; It was
nearly extirpated in these regions, but it is springing up again,
owing <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to circumstances.&nbsp; Radicalism is
a good friend to us; all the liberals laud up our system out of 
hatred to the Established Church, though our system is ten times 
less liberal than the Church of England.&nbsp; Some of them have 
really come over to us.&nbsp; I myself confess a baronet who 
presided over the first radical meeting ever held in 
England&mdash;he was an atheist when he came over to us, in the 
hope of mortifying his own church&mdash;but he is now&mdash;ho! 
ho!&mdash;a real Catholic devotee&mdash;quite afraid of my 
threats; I make him frequently scourge himself before me.&nbsp; 
Well, Radicalism does us good service, especially amongst the 
lower classes, for Radicalism chiefly flourishes amongst them; 
for though a baronet or two may be found amongst the radicals, 
and perhaps as many lords&mdash;fellows who have been discarded 
by their own order for clownishness, or something they have 
done&mdash;it incontestably flourishes best among the lower 
orders.&nbsp; Then the love of what is foreign is a great friend 
to us; this love is chiefly confined to the middle and upper 
classes.&nbsp; Some admire the French, and imitate them; others 
must needs be Spaniards, dress themselves up in a zamarra, stick 
a cigar in their mouths, and say, &lsquo;Carajo.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Others would pass for Germans; he! he! the idea of any one 
wishing to pass for a German! but what has done us more service 
than anything else in these regions&mdash;I mean amidst the 
middle classes&mdash;has been the novel, the Scotch novel.&nbsp; 
The good folks, since they have read the novels, have become 
Jacobites; and, because all the Jacobs were Papists, the good 
folks must become Papists also, or, at least, papistically 
inclined.&nbsp; The very Scotch Presbyterians, since they have 
read the novels, are become all but Papists; I speak advisedly, 
having lately been amongst them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a trumpery 
bit of a half papist sect, called the Scotch Episcopalian Church,
which lay dormant and nearly forgotten for upwards of a hundred 
years, which has of late got wonderfully into fashion in 
Scotland, because, forsooth, some of the long-haired gentry of 
the novels were said to belong to it, such as Montrose and 
Dundee; and to this the Presbyterians are going over in throngs, 
traducing and vilifying their own forefathers, or denying them 
altogether, and calling themselves descendants of&mdash;ho! ho! 
ho!&mdash;Scottish Cavaliers!!!&nbsp; I have heard them myself 
repeating snatches of Jacobite ditties about &lsquo;Bonnie 
Dundee,&rsquo; and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, fill up my cup, and fill up my
can,<br />
And saddle my horse, and call up my man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>There&rsquo;s stuff for you!&nbsp; Not that I object to 
the first part of the ditty.&nbsp; It is natural enough that a 
Scotchman should cry, &lsquo;Come, fill up my cup!&rsquo; more 
especially if he&rsquo;s drinking at another person&rsquo;s 
expense&mdash;all Scotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost: 
but &lsquo;Saddle his horse!!!&rsquo;&mdash;for what purpose I 
would ask?&nbsp; Where is the use of saddling a horse, unless you
can ride him? and where was there ever a Scotchman who could 
ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have not a drop of Scotch blood in your 
veins,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;otherwise you would never have 
uttered that last sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;you know little of Popery if you imagine that it 
cannot extinguish love of country, even in a Scotchman.&nbsp; A 
thorough-going Papist&mdash;and who more thorough-going than 
myself&mdash;cares nothing for his country; and why should he? he
belongs to a system, and not to a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;connected with you, I 
cannot understand; you call yourself a thorough-going Papist, yet
are continually saying the most pungent things against Popery, 
and turning to unbounded ridicule those who show any inclination 
to embrace it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rome is a very sensible old body,&rdquo; said the man 
in black, &ldquo;and little cares what her children say, provided
they do her bidding.&nbsp; She knows several things, and amongst 
others, that no servants work so hard and faithfully as those who
curse their masters at every stroke they do.&nbsp; She was not 
fool enough to be angry with the Miquelets of Alba, who renounced
her, and called her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; all the time they were 
cutting the throats of the Netherlanders.&nbsp; Now, if she 
allowed her faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing her, and
calling her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; in the market-place, think not she
is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests 
occasionally calling her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; in the 
dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose some one were to 
tell the world some of the disorderly things which her priests 
say in the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have the fate of Cassandra,&rdquo; said the 
man in black; &ldquo;no one would believe him&mdash;yes, the 
priests would: but they would make no sign of belief.&nbsp; They 
believe in the Alcoran des Cordeliers&mdash;that is, those who 
have read it; but they make no sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty system,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which 
extinguishes love of <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>country and of everything noble, and 
brings the minds of its ministers to a parity with those of 
devils, who delight in nothing but mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The system,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a 
grand one, with unbounded vitality.&nbsp; Compare it with your 
Protestantism, and you will see the difference.&nbsp; Popery is 
ever at work, whilst Protestantism is supine.&nbsp; A pretty 
church, indeed, the Protestant!&nbsp; Why, it can&rsquo;t even 
work a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can your church work miracles?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the very question,&rdquo; said the man in 
black, &ldquo;which the ancient British clergy asked of Austin 
Monk, after they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own 
inability.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t pretend to work miracles; 
do you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! dear me, yes,&rsquo; said Austin;
&lsquo;we find no difficulty in the matter.&nbsp; We can raise 
the dead, we can make the blind see; and to convince you, I will 
give sight to the blind.&nbsp; Here is this blind Saxon, whom you
cannot cure, but on whose eyes I will manifest my power, in order
to show the difference between the true and the false 
church;&rsquo; and forthwith, with the assistance of a 
handkerchief and a little hot water, he opened the eyes of the 
barbarian.&nbsp; So we manage matters!&nbsp; A pretty church, 
that old British church, which could not work 
miracles&mdash;quite as helpless as the modern one.&nbsp; The 
fools! was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst them?&mdash;and 
were the properties of warm water so unknown to them, that they 
could not close a pair of eyes and open them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the 
British clergy at that interview with Austin, did not bring 
forward a blind Welshman, and ask the monk to operate upon 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they ought to have done; but they were 
fools without a single resource.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he took a sip 
at his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did not believe in the miracle?&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did their not believing avail them?&rdquo; 
said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;Austin remained master of the
field, and they went away holding their heads down, and muttering
to themselves.&nbsp; What a fine subject for a painting would be 
Austin&rsquo;s opening the eyes of the Saxon barbarian, and the 
discomfiture of the British clergy!&nbsp; I wonder it has not 
been painted!&mdash;he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your church still performs miracles 
occasionally?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The Rev. . . . has lately been performing miracles in 
Ireland, destroying devils that had got possession of people; he 
has been eminently successful.&nbsp; In two instances he not only
destroyed the devils, but the lives of the people 
possessed&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Oh! there is so much energy in our 
system; we are always at work, whilst Protestantism is 
supine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that all 
Protestants are supine; some of them appear to be filled with 
unbounded zeal.&nbsp; They deal, it is true, not in lying 
miracles, but they propagate God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; I remember 
only a few months ago, having occasion for a Bible, going to an 
establishment, the object of which was to send Bibles all over 
the world.&nbsp; The supporters of that establishment could have 
no self-interested views; for I was supplied by them with a 
noble-sized Bible at a price so small as to preclude the idea 
that it could bring any profit to the vendors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the man in black slightly fell.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I know the people to whom you allude,&rdquo; said he; 
&ldquo;indeed, unknown to them, I have frequently been to see 
them, and observed their ways.&nbsp; I tell you frankly that 
there is not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our 
church so much trouble and uneasiness.&nbsp; I should rather say 
that they alone cause us any; for as for the rest, what with 
their drowsiness, their plethora, their folly, and their vanity, 
they are doing us anything but mischief.&nbsp; These fellows are 
a pestilent set of heretics, whom we would gladly see burnt; they
are, with the most untiring perseverance, and in spite of divers 
minatory declarations of the holy father, scattering their books 
abroad through all Europe, and have caused many people in 
Catholic countries to think that hitherto their priesthood have 
endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep them blinded.&nbsp; 
There is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain a 
particular aversion; a big, burly parson, with the face of a 
lion, the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like a 
sledge-hammer.&nbsp; The last time I was there, I observed that 
his eye was upon me, and I did not like the glance he gave me at 
all; I observed him clench his fist, and I took my departure as 
fast as I conveniently could.&nbsp; Whether he suspected who I 
was, I know not; but I did not like his look at all, and do not 
intend to go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you confess that you 
have redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions, and that
even <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>amongst the ecclesiastics there are some widely 
different from those of the plethoric and Platitude 
schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but too true,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;and if the rest of your church were like them we should 
quickly bid adieu to all hope of converting these regions, but we
are thankful to be able to say that such folks are not numerous; 
there are, moreover, causes at work quite sufficient to undermine
even their zeal.&nbsp; Their sons return at the vacations, from 
Oxford and Cambridge, puppies, full of the nonsense which they 
have imbibed from Platitude professors; and this nonsense they 
retail at home, where it fails not to make some impression, 
whilst the daughters scream&mdash;I beg their 
pardons&mdash;warble about Scotland&rsquo;s Montrose, and Bonny 
Dundee, and all the Jacobs; so we have no doubt that their 
papas&rsquo; zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as 
the Bible will in a very little time be terribly 
diminished.&nbsp; Old Rome will win, so you had better join 
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man in black drained the last drop in his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will I become the slave of
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you latitude,&rdquo; said the man in 
black; &ldquo;do but serve her, and she will allow you to call 
her &lsquo;puta&rsquo; at a decent time and place; her popes 
occasionally call her &lsquo;puta.&rsquo;&nbsp; A pope has been 
known to start from his bed at midnight and rush out into the 
corridor, and call out &lsquo;puta&rsquo; three times in a voice 
which pierced the Vatican; that pope was . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander the Sixth, I dare say,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;the greatest monster that ever existed, though the 
worthiest head which the popish system ever had&mdash;so his 
conscience was not always still.&nbsp; I thought it had been 
seared with a brand of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not allude to him, but to a much more modern 
pope,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;it is true he brought 
the word, which is Spanish, from Spain, his native country, to 
Rome.&nbsp; He was very fond of calling the church by that name, 
and other popes have taken it up.&nbsp; She will allow you to 
call her by it if you belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call her so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;without 
belonging to her, or asking her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you to treat her as such if you belong 
to her,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a 
chapel in Rome, where there is a wondrously fair statue&mdash;the
son of a cardinal&mdash;I mean his nephew&mdash;once . . . Well, 
she did not cut off his head, but slightly boxed his cheek and 
bade him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>&ldquo;I have read all about that in 
&lsquo;Keysler&rsquo;s Travels,&rsquo;&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;do 
you tell her that I would not touch her with a pair of tongs, 
unless to seize her nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is fond of lucre,&rdquo; said the man in black; 
&ldquo;but does not grudge a faithful priest a little private 
perquisite,&rdquo; and he took out a very handsome gold 
repeater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to flash that
watch before the eyes of a poor tinker in a dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before the eyes of one like you,&rdquo; said the 
man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I care not 
for perquisites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you will not join us?&rdquo; said the man in 
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had my answer,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I belong to Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, 
&ldquo;why should not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a poor tinker,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I may
never have undergone what you have.&nbsp; You remember, perhaps, 
the fable of the fox who had lost his tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black winced, but almost immediately recovering 
himself, he said, &ldquo;Well, we can do without you, we are sure
of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the part of wise people,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;to make sure of the battle before it is fought: 
there&rsquo;s the landlord of the public-house, who made sure 
that his cocks would win, yet the cocks lost the main, and the 
landlord is little better than a bankrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People very different from the landlord,&rdquo; said 
the man in black, &ldquo;both in intellect and station, think we 
shall surely win; there are clever machinators among us who have 
no doubt of our success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will set the landlord 
aside, and will adduce one who was in every point a very 
different person from the landlord, both in understanding and 
station; he was very fond of laying schemes, and, indeed, many of
them turned out successful.&nbsp; His last and darling one, 
however, miscarried, notwithstanding that by his calculations he 
had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its 
failing&mdash;the person that I allude to was old Fraser . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said the man in black, giving a start, and 
letting his glass fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Fraser, of Lovat,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the prince 
of all conspirators and machinators; he made sure of placing the 
Pretender on the throne of these realms.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can bring
into <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>the field so many men,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;my 
son-in-law, Cluny, so many, and likewise my cousin, and my good 
friend;&rsquo; then speaking of those on whom the government 
reckoned for support, he would say, &lsquo;So-and-so are 
lukewarm; this person is ruled by his wife, who is with us; the 
clergy are anything but hostile to us; and as for the soldiers 
and sailors, half are disaffected to King George, and the rest 
cowards.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet, when things came to a trial, this 
person whom he had calculated upon to join the Pretender did not 
stir from his home, another joined the hostile ranks, the 
presumed cowards turned out heroes, and those whom he thought 
heroes ran away like lusty fellows at Culloden; in a word, he 
found himself utterly mistaken, and in nothing more than himself;
he thought he was a hero, and proved himself nothing more than an
old fox; he got up a hollow tree, didn&rsquo;t he, just like a 
fox?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;L&rsquo; opere sue non furon 
leonine, ma di volpe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man in black sat silent for a considerable time, and at 
length answered, in rather a faltering voice, &ldquo;I was not 
prepared for this; you have frequently surprised me by your 
knowledge of things which I should never have expected any person
of your appearance to be acquainted with, but that you should be 
aware of my name is a circumstance utterly incomprehensible to 
me.&nbsp; I had imagined that no person in England was acquainted
with it; indeed, I don&rsquo;t see how any person should be, I 
have revealed it to no one, not being particularly proud of 
it.&nbsp; Yes, I acknowledge that my name is Fraser, and that I 
am of the blood of that family or clan, of which the rector of 
our college once said that he was firmly of opinion that every 
individual member was either rogue or fool.&nbsp; I was born at 
Madrid, of pure, <i>oim&egrave;</i>, Fraser blood.&nbsp; My 
parents at an early age took me to ---, where they shortly died, 
not, however, before they had placed me in the service of a 
cardinal with whom I continued some years, and who, when he had 
no further occasion for me, sent me to the college, in the 
left-hand cloister of which, as you enter, rest the bones of Sir 
John D. . .; there, in studying logic and humane letters, I lost 
whatever of humanity I had retained when discarded by the 
cardinal.&nbsp; Let me not, however, forget two points&mdash;I am
a Fraser, it is true, but not a Flannagan; I may bear the vilest 
name of Britain, but not of Ireland; I was bred up at the English
house, and there is at --- a house for the education <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of 
bog-trotters; I was not bred up at that; beneath the lowest gulf,
there is one yet lower; whatever my blood may be, it is at least 
not Irish; whatever my education may have been, I was not bred at
the Irish seminary&mdash;on those accounts I am 
thankful&mdash;yes, <i>per dio</i>!&nbsp; I am thankful.&nbsp; 
After some years at college&mdash;but why should I tell you my 
history, you know it already perfectly well, probably much better
than myself.&nbsp; I am now a missionary priest labouring in 
heretic England, like Parsons and Garnet of old, save and except 
that, unlike them, I run no danger, for the times are 
changed.&nbsp; As I told you before, I shall cleave to 
Rome&mdash;I must; <i>no hay remedio</i>, as they say at Madrid, 
and I will do my best to further her holy plans&mdash;he! 
he!&mdash;but I confess I begin to doubt of their being 
successful here&mdash;you put me out; old Fraser, of Lovat!&nbsp;
I have heard my father talk of him; he had a gold-headed cane, 
with which he once knocked my grandfather down&mdash;he was an 
astute one, but, as you say, mistaken, particularly in 
himself.&nbsp; I have read his life by Arbuthnot, it is in the 
library of our college.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; I shall come no 
more to this dingle&mdash;to come would be of no utility; I shall
go and labour elsewhere, though . . . how you came to know my 
name is a fact quite inexplicable&mdash;farewell! to you 
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then arose; and without further salutation departed from 
the dingle, in which I never saw him again.&nbsp; &ldquo;How, in 
the name of wonder, came you to know that man&rsquo;s 
name?&rdquo; said Belle, after he had been gone some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Belle?&nbsp; I knew nothing of the fellow&rsquo;s 
name, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mentioned his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, it was merely casually, by way of 
illustration.&nbsp; I was saying how frequently cunning people 
were mistaken in their calculations, and I adduced the case of 
old Fraser, of Lovat, as one in point; I brought forward his 
name, because I was well acquainted with his history, from having
compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work, which I edited some
months ago, entitled &lsquo;Newgate Lives and Trials,&rsquo; but 
without the slightest idea that it was the name of him who was 
sitting with us; he, however, thought that I was aware of his 
name.&nbsp; Belle! Belle! for a long time I doubted in the truth 
of Scripture, owing to certain conceited discourses which I had 
heard from certain conceited individuals, but now I begin to 
believe firmly; what wonderful texts there are in Scripture, 
Belle!&nbsp; &lsquo;The wicked trembleth where&mdash;where . . 
.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;They were afraid where no fear was; thou 
hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised 
them,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I have frequently read it 
before the clergyman in the great house of Long Melford.&nbsp; 
But if you did not know the man&rsquo;s name, why let him go away
supposing that you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he was fool enough to make such a mistake, I was
not going to undeceive him&mdash;no, no!&nbsp; Let the enemies of
old England make the most of all their blunders and mistakes, 
they will have no help from me; but enough of the fellow, Belle, 
let us now have tea, and after that . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Armenian,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I want to 
ask a question: pray are all people of that man&rsquo;s name 
either rogues or fools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to say, Belle, this person 
being the only one of the name I have ever personally 
known.&nbsp; I suppose there are good and bad, clever and 
foolish, amongst them, as amongst all large bodies of people; 
however, after the tribe had been governed for upwards of thirty 
years by such a person as old Fraser, it were no wonder if the 
greater part had become either rogues or fools: he was a ruthless
tyrant, Belle, over his own people, and by his cruelty and 
rapaciousness must either have stunned them into an apathy 
approaching to idiocy, or made them artful knaves in their own 
defence.&nbsp; The qualities of parents are generally transmitted
to their descendants&mdash;the progeny of trained pointers are 
almost sure to point, even without being taught: if, therefore, 
all Frasers are either rogues or fools, as this person seems to 
insinuate, it is little to be wondered at, their parents or 
grandparents having been in the training-school of old Fraser! 
but enough of the old tyrant and his slaves.&nbsp; Belle, prepare
tea this moment, or dread my anger.&nbsp; I have not a 
gold-headed cane like old Fraser of Lovat, but I have, what some 
people would dread much more, an Armenian rune-stick.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>FRESH ARRIVALS&mdash;PITCHING THE TENT&mdash;CERTIFICATED 
WIFE&mdash;HIGH-FLYING NOTIONS.</p>
<p>On the following morning, as I was about to leave my tent, I 
heard the voice of Belle at the door, exclaiming, &ldquo;Sleepest
thou, or wakest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was never more awake 
in my life,&rdquo; <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>said I, going out.&nbsp; &ldquo;What 
is the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He of the horse-shoe,&rdquo; 
said she, &ldquo;Jasper, of whom I have heard you talk, is above 
there on the field with all his people; I went about a quarter of
an hour ago to fill the kettle at the spring, and saw them 
arriving.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;have you any objection to asking him and his wife to 
breakfast?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can do as you please,&rdquo; 
said she; &ldquo;I have cups enough, and have no objection to 
their company.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are the first occupiers of 
the ground,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, being so, should consider 
ourselves in the light of hosts, and do our best to practise the 
duties of hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How fond you are of 
using that word!&rdquo; said Belle: &ldquo;if you wish to invite 
the man and his wife, do so, without more ado; remember, however,
that I have not cups enough, nor indeed tea enough, for the whole
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon hurrying up the ascent, I 
presently found myself outside the dingle.&nbsp; It was as usual 
a brilliant morning, the dewy blades of the rye grass which 
covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams of the sun, 
which had probably been about two hours above the horizon.&nbsp; 
A rather numerous body of my ancient friends and allies occupied 
the ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the dingle.&nbsp; 
About five yards on the right I perceived Mr. Petulengro busily 
employed in erecting his tent; he held in his hand an iron bar, 
sharp at the bottom, with a kind of arm projecting from the top 
for the purpose of supporting a kettle or cauldron over the fire,
and which is called in the Romanian language &ldquo;Kekauviskoe 
saster.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the sharp end of this Mr. Petulengro 
was making holes in the earth at about twenty inches&rsquo; 
distance from each other, into which he inserted certain long 
rods with a considerable bend towards the top, which constituted 
no less than the timbers of the tent, and the supporters of the 
canvas.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro and a female with a crutch in her 
hand, whom I recognised as Mrs. Chikno, sat near him on the 
ground, whilst two or three children, from six to ten years old, 
who composed the young family of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro, were 
playing about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, as he
drove the sharp end of the bar into the ground; &ldquo;here we 
are, and plenty of us&mdash;Bute dosta Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you all,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and 
particularly you, madam,&rdquo; said I, making a bow to Mrs. 
Petulengro; &ldquo;and you also, madam,&rdquo; taking off my hat 
to Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;you look <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>as usual, charmingly, and speak so, 
too; you have not forgot your manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not all gold that glitters,&rdquo; said Mrs. 
Chikno.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, good-morrow to you, young 
rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see Tawno,&rdquo; said I, looking around; 
&ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno; &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t know; he who countenances him in the roving line can 
best answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here anon,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;he has merely ridden down a by-road to show a farmer a 
two-year-old colt; she heard me give him directions, but she 
can&rsquo;t be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I place no confidence in your words, brother; 
as I said before, you countenances him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know nothing of your 
private concerns; I am come on an errand.&nbsp; Isopel Berners, 
down in the dell there, requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. 
Petulengro&rsquo;s company at breakfast.&nbsp; She will be happy 
also to see you, madam,&rdquo; said I, addressing Mrs. 
Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young female your wife, young man?&rdquo; said 
Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, young man, your wife, your lawful certificated 
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she is not my 
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will not visit with her,&rdquo; said Mrs. 
Chikno; &ldquo;I countenance nothing in the roving 
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the roving line?&rdquo; I 
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I mean by the roving line?&nbsp; Why, by it I 
mean such conduct as is not tatcheno.&nbsp; When ryes and rawnies
lives together in dingles, without being certificated, I calls 
such behaviour being tolerably deep in the roving line, 
everything savouring of which I am determined not to 
sanctify.&nbsp; I have suffered too much by my own certificated 
husband&rsquo;s outbreaks in that line to afford anything of the 
kind the slightest shadow of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard that people may not live in dingles together
without being suspected of doing wrong,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, interposing; 
&ldquo;and, to tell you the truth, I am altogether surprised at 
the illiberality of my sister&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; I have often
heard say, that is in good company&mdash;and I have kept good 
company in my time&mdash;that suspicion is king&rsquo;s evidence 
of a narrow and uncultivated mind; <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>on which 
account I am suspicious of nobody, not even of my own husband, 
whom some people would think I have a right to be suspicious of, 
seeing that on his account I once refused a lord; but ask him 
whether I am suspicious of him, and whether I seeks to keep him 
close tied to my apron-string; he will tell you nothing of the 
kind; but that, on the contrary, I always allows him an agreeable
latitude, permitting him to go where he pleases, and to converse 
with any one to whose manner of speaking he may take a 
fancy.&nbsp; But I have had the advantage of keeping good 
company, and therefore . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meklis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;pray drop all 
that, sister; I believe I have kept as good company as yourself; 
and with respect to that offer with which you frequently fatigue 
those who keeps company with you, I believe, after all, it was 
something in the roving and uncertificated line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In whatever line it was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, 
&ldquo;the offer was a good one.&nbsp; The young duke&mdash;for 
he was not only a lord, but a duke too&mdash;offered to keep me a
fine carriage, and to make me his second wife; for it is true 
that he had another who was old and stout, though mighty rich, 
and highly good natured; so much so, indeed, that the young lord 
assured me that she would have no manner of objection to the 
arrangement; more especially if I would consent to live in the 
same house with her, being fond of young and cheerful 
society.&nbsp; So you see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;I see, what I
before thought, that it was altogether in the uncertificated 
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meklis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I use your 
own word, madam, which is Romany; for my own part, I am not fond 
of using Romany words, unless I can hope to pass them off for 
French, which I cannot in the present company.&nbsp; I heartily 
wish that there was no such language, and do my best to keep it 
away from my children, lest the frequent use of it should 
altogether confirm them in low and vulgar habits.&nbsp; I have 
four children, madam, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose by talking of your four children you wish to 
check me for having none,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, bursting into 
tears; &ldquo;if I have no children, sister, it is no fault of 
mine, it is&mdash;but why do I call you sister,&rdquo; said she, 
angrily, &ldquo;you are no sister of mine, you are a grasni, a 
regular mare&mdash;a pretty sister, indeed, ashamed of your own 
language.&nbsp; I remember well that by your high-flying notions 
you drove your own mother . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>&ldquo;We will drop it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;I do not wish to raise my voice, and to make myself 
ridiculous.&nbsp; Young gentleman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;pray 
present my compliments to Miss Isopel Berners, and inform her 
that I am very sorry that I cannot accept her polite 
invitation.&nbsp; I am just arrived, and have some slight 
domestic matters to see to, amongst others, to wash my 
children&rsquo;s faces; but that in the course of the forenoon 
when I have attended to what I have to do, and have dressed 
myself, I hope to do myself the honour of paying her a regular 
visit; you will tell her that with my compliments.&nbsp; With 
respect to my husband he can answer for himself, as I, not being 
of a jealous disposition, never interferes with his 
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell Miss Berners,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, 
&ldquo;that I shall be happy to wait upon her in company with my 
wife as soon as we are regularly settled: at present I have much 
on my hands, having not only to pitch my own tent, but this here 
jealous woman&rsquo;s, whose husband is absent on my 
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I returned to the dingle, and without saying 
anything about Mrs. Chikno&rsquo;s observations, communicated to 
Isopel the messages of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro; Isopel made no 
other reply than by replacing in her coffer two additional cups 
and saucers, which, in expectation of company, she had placed 
upon the board.&nbsp; The kettle was by this time boiling.&nbsp; 
We sat down, and as we breakfasted, I gave Isopel Berners another
lesson in the Armenian language.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>THE PROMISED VISIT&mdash;ROMAN FASHION&mdash;WIZARD AND 
WITCH&mdash;CATCHING AT WORDS&mdash;THE TWO 
FEMALES&mdash;DRESSING OF HAIR&mdash;THE NEW 
ROADS&mdash;BELLE&rsquo;S ALTERED APPEARANCE&mdash;HERSELF 
AGAIN.</p>
<p>About mid-day Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro came to the dingle to 
pay the promised visit.&nbsp; Belle, at the time of their 
arrival, was in her tent, but I was at the fireplace, engaged in 
hammering part of the outer-tire, or defence, which had come off 
from one of the wheels of my vehicle.&nbsp; On perceiving them I 
forthwith went to receive them.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro was dressed 
in Roman fashion, with a somewhat smartly-cut sporting-coat, <!--
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>the buttons of which were half-crowns&mdash;and a 
waistcoat, scarlet and black, the buttons of which were spaded 
half-guineas; his breeches were of a stuff half velveteen, half 
corduroy, the cords exceedingly broad.&nbsp; He had leggings of 
buff cloth, furred at the bottom; and upon his feet were 
highlows.&nbsp; Under his left arm was a long black whalebone 
riding-whip, with a red lash, and an immense silver knob.&nbsp; 
Upon his head was a hat with a high peak, somewhat of the kind 
which the Spaniards call <i>calan&eacute;</i>, so much in favour 
with the bravos of Seville and Madrid.&nbsp; Now when I have 
added that Mr. Petulengro had on a very fine white holland shirt,
I think I have described his array.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro&mdash;I
beg pardon for not having spoken of her first&mdash;was also 
arrayed very much in the Roman fashion.&nbsp; Her hair, which was
exceedingly black and lustrous, fell in braids on either side of 
her head.&nbsp; In her ears were rings, with long drops of 
gold.&nbsp; Round her neck was a string of what seemed very much 
like very large pearls, somewhat tarnished, however, and 
apparently of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;here we are, come to 
see you&mdash;wizard and witch, witch and wizard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a chovahanee, and a 
chovahano,<br />
The nav se len is Petulengro.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;you make me ashamed of you with your vulgar ditties.&nbsp;
We are come a-visiting now, and everything low should be left 
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;why bring 
what&rsquo;s low to the dingle, which is low enough 
already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you a catcher at words?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I thought that catching at words had been confined to the 
pothouse farmers and village witty bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fools,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;catch at
words, and very naturally, as by so doing they hope to prevent 
the possibility of rational conversation.&nbsp; Catching at words
confined to pothouse farmers and village witty bodies!&nbsp; No, 
nor to Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; Listen for an hour or two to the 
discourse of a set they call newspaper editors, and if you 
don&rsquo;t go out and eat grass, as a dog does when he is sick, 
I am no female woman.&nbsp; The young lord whose hand I refused 
when I took up with wise Jasper once brought two of them to my 
mother&rsquo;s tan, when hankering after my company; they did 
nothing but carp at each other&rsquo;s words, and a pretty hand 
they made of it.&nbsp; <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Ill-favoured dogs they were; and 
their attempts at what they called wit almost as unfortunate as 
their countenances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;madam, we will drop all 
catchings and carpings for the present.&nbsp; Pray take your seat
on this stool whilst I go and announce to Miss Isopel Berners 
your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I went to Belle&rsquo;s habitation, and informed her
that Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony, and
were awaiting her at the fire-place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray go and 
tell them that I am busy,&rdquo; said Belle, who was engaged with
her needle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not feel disposed to take part in 
any such nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall do no such 
thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I insist upon your coming 
forthwith, and showing proper courtesy to your visitors.&nbsp; If
you do not their feelings will be hurt, and you are aware that I 
cannot bear that people&rsquo;s feelings should be 
outraged.&nbsp; Come this moment, or&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Or 
what?&rdquo; said Belle, half smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was about 
to say something in Armenian,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Belle, laying down her work, &ldquo;I 
will come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your 
hair is hanging about your ears, and your dress is in disorder; 
you had better stay a minute or two to prepare yourself to appear
before your visitors, who have come in their very best 
attire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I will 
make no alteration in my appearance; you told me to come this 
moment, and you shall be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Belle and I advanced towards our guests.&nbsp; As we drew 
nigh Mr. Petulengro took off his hat and made a profound 
obeisance to Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro rose from the stool 
and made a profound curtsey.&nbsp; Belle, who had flung her hair 
back over her shoulders, returned their salutations by bending 
her head, and after slightly glancing at Mr. Petulengro, fixed 
her large blue eyes full upon his wife.&nbsp; Both these females 
were very handsome&mdash;but how unlike!&nbsp; Belle fair, with 
blue eyes and flaxen hair; Mrs. Petulengro with olive complexion,
eyes black, and hair dark&mdash;as dark could be.&nbsp; Belle, in
demeanour calm and proud; the gypsy graceful, but full of 
movement and agitation.&nbsp; And then how different were those 
two in stature!&nbsp; The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely 
ascended to the breast of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I could see that 
Mrs. Petulengro gazed on Belle with unmixed admiration: so did 
her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter, 
&ldquo;one thing I will say, which is, that there is only one on 
earth worthy to stand up in front of this she, and that is the 
beauty of the world, as far as man flesh is concerned, Tawno 
Chikno; what a pity he did not come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>&ldquo;Tawno Chikno,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, 
flaring up; &ldquo;a pretty fellow he to stand up in front of 
this gentlewoman, a pity he didn&rsquo;t come, quotha? not at 
all, the fellow is a sneak, afraid of his wife.&nbsp; He stand up
against this rawnie! why the look she has given me would knock 
the fellow down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a 
fist,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that is, if the look 
comes from a woman: not that I am disposed to doubt that this 
female gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or 
the other.&nbsp; I have heard of her often enough, and have seen 
her once or twice, though not so near as now.&nbsp; Well, 
ma&rsquo;am, my wife and I are come to pay our respects to you; 
we are both glad to find that you have left off keeping company 
with Flaming Bosville, and have taken up with my pal; he is not 
very handsome, but a better . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take up with your pal, as you call him; you had 
better mind what you say,&rdquo; said Isopel Berners, &ldquo;I 
take up with nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely mean taking up your quarters with him,&rdquo; 
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;and I was only about to say a better 
fellow-lodger you cannot have, or a more instructive, especially 
if you have a desire to be inoculated with tongues, as he calls 
them.&nbsp; I wonder whether you and he have had any tongue-work 
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you and your wife anything particular to 
say?&nbsp; If you have nothing but this kind of conversation I 
must leave you, as I am going to make a journey this afternoon, 
and should be getting ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my husband, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. 
Petulengro; &ldquo;he is not overburdened with understanding, and
has said but one word of sense since he has been here, which was 
that we came to pay our respects to you.&nbsp; We have dressed 
ourselves in our best Roman way, in order to do honour to you; 
perhaps you do not like it; if so, I am sorry.&nbsp; I have no 
French clothes, madam; if I had any, madam, I would have come in 
them in order to do you more honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to see you much better as you are,&rdquo; said 
Belle; &ldquo;people should keep to their own fashions, and yours
is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are pleased to think it so, madam; it has
been admired in the great city, it created what they call a 
sensation, and some of the great ladies, the court ladies, 
imitated it, else I should not appear in it so often as I am 
accustomed; for I am not very fond of what is Roman, having an 
imagination <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>that what is Roman is ungenteel; in 
fact, I once heard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies 
were vulgar creatures.&nbsp; I should have taken her saying very 
much to heart, but for her improper pronunciation; she could not 
pronounce her words, madam, which we gypsies, as they call us, 
usually can, so I thought she was no very high purchase.&nbsp; 
You are very beautiful, madam, though you are not dressed as I 
could wish to see you, and your hair is hanging down in sad 
confusion; allow me to assist you in arranging your hair, madam; 
I will dress it for you in our fashion; I would fain see how your
hair would look in our poor gypsy fashion; pray allow me, 
madam?&rdquo; and she took Belle by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle, 
withdrawing her hand; &ldquo;I thank you for coming to see me, 
but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,&rdquo; 
said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;I should esteem your allowing me a 
great mark of condescension.&nbsp; You are very beautiful, madam,
and I think you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have a 
great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair; I have a
less regard for people with dark hair and complexions, 
madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you turn off the lord, and take up with 
me?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that same lord was fair 
enough all about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do when they are young and silly what they 
sometimes repent of when they are of riper years and 
understandings.&nbsp; I sometimes think that had I not been 
something of a simpleton, I might at this time be a great court 
lady.&nbsp; Now, madam,&rdquo; said she, again taking Belle by 
the hand, &ldquo;do oblige me by allowing me to plait your hair a
little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have really a good mind to be angry with you,&rdquo; 
said Belle, giving Mrs. Petulengro a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow her to arrange your hair,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;she means no harm, and wishes to do you honour; do oblige 
her and me too; for I should like to see how your hair would look
dressed in her fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what the young rye says?&rdquo; said Mrs. 
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure you will oblige the young rye,
if not myself.&nbsp; Many people would be willing to oblige the 
young rye, if he would but ask them; but he is not in the habit 
of asking favours.&nbsp; He has a nose of his own, which he keeps
tolerably exalted; he does not think small-beer of himself, 
madam; and all the time I have been with him, I never heard him 
ask a <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>favour before; therefore, madam, I am
sure you will oblige him.&nbsp; My sister Ursula would be very 
willing to oblige him in many things, but he will not ask her for
anything, except for such a favour as a word, which is a poor 
favour after all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean for her word; perhaps 
he will some day ask you for your word.&nbsp; If so . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why here you are, after railing at me for catching at 
words, catching at a word yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. 
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me in my 
discourse; if I caught at a word now, I am not in the habit of 
doing so.&nbsp; I am no conceited body; no newspaper Neddy; no 
pothouse witty person.&nbsp; I was about to say, madam, that if 
the young rye asks you at any time for your word, you will do as 
you deem convenient; but I am sure you will oblige him by 
allowing me to braid your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not do it to oblige him,&rdquo; said Belle; 
&ldquo;the young rye, as you call him, is nothing to 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to oblige me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;do allow me to become your poor tire-woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is great nonsense,&rdquo; said Belle, reddening; 
&ldquo;however, as you came to see me, and ask the matter as a 
particular favour to yourself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, leading 
Belle to the stool; &ldquo;please to sit down here.&nbsp; Thank 
you; your hair is very beautiful, madam,&rdquo; she continued, as
she proceeded to braid Belle&rsquo;s hair; &ldquo;so is your 
countenance.&nbsp; Should you ever go to the great city, among 
the grand folks, you would make a sensation, madam.&nbsp; I have 
made one myself, who am dark; the chi she is kauley, which last 
word signifies black, which I am not, though rather dark.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s no colour like white, madam; it&rsquo;s so lasting,
so genteel.&nbsp; Gentility will carry the day, madam, even with 
the young rye.&nbsp; He will ask words of the black lass, but beg
the word of the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Petulengro and myself entered into 
conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any news stirring, Mr. 
Petulengro?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you heard anything 
of the great religious movements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;all the 
religious people, more especially the Evangelicals&mdash;those 
that go about distributing tracts&mdash;are very angry about the 
fight between Gentleman Cooper and White-headed Bob, which they 
say ought not to have been permitted to take place; and then they
are trying all they can to prevent the fight between the lion and
the dogs, <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>which they say is a disgrace to a 
Christian country.&nbsp; Now, I can&rsquo;t say that I have any 
quarrel with the religious party and the Evangelicals; they are 
always civil to me and mine, and frequently give us tracts, as 
they call them, which neither I nor mine can read; but I cannot 
say that I approve of any movements, religious or not, which have
in aim to put down all life and manly sport in this here 
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are becoming vastly sharp,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro; &ldquo;and I am told that all the old-fashioned, 
good-tempered constables are going to be set aside, and a paid 
body of men to be established, who are not to permit a tramper or
vagabond on the roads of England;&mdash;and talking of roads puts
me in mind of a strange story I heard two nights ago, whilst 
drinking some beer at a public-house, in company with my cousin 
Sylvester.&nbsp; I had asked Tawno to go, but his wife would not 
let him.&nbsp; Just opposite me, smoking their pipes, were a 
couple of men, something like engineers, and they were talking of
a wonderful invention which was to make a wonderful alteration in
England; inasmuch as it would set aside all the old roads, which 
in a little time would be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and 
cause all England to be laid down with iron roads, on which 
people would go thundering along in vehicles, pushed forward by 
fire and smoke.&nbsp; Now, brother, when I heard this, I did not 
feel very comfortable; for I thought to myself, what a queer 
place such a road would be to pitch one&rsquo;s tent upon, and 
how impossible it would be for one&rsquo;s cattle to find a bite 
of grass upon it; and I thought likewise of the danger to which 
one&rsquo;s family would be exposed of being run over and 
severely scorched by these same flying, fiery vehicles; so I made
bold to say that I hoped such an invention would never be 
countenanced, because it was likely to do a great deal of 
harm.&nbsp; Whereupon, one of the men, giving me a glance, said, 
without taking the pipe out of his mouth, that for his part he 
sincerely hoped that it would take effect; and if it did no other
good than stopping the rambles of gypsies, and other like scamps,
it ought to be encouraged.&nbsp; Well, brother, feeling myself 
insulted, I put my hand into my pocket, in order to pull out 
money, intending to challenge him to fight for a five-shilling 
stake, but merely found sixpence, having left all my other money 
at the tent; which sixpence was just sufficient to pay for the 
beer which Sylvester and myself were drinking, of <!-- page 
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>whom 
I couldn&rsquo;t hope to borrow anything&mdash;&lsquo;poor as 
Sylvester&rsquo; being a by-word amongst us.&nbsp; So, not being 
able to back myself, I held my peace, and let the Gorgio have it 
all his own way, who, after turning up his nose at me, went on 
discoursing about the said invention, saying what a fund of 
profit it would be to those who knew how to make use of it, and 
should have the laying down of the new roads, and the shoeing of 
England with iron.&nbsp; And after he had said this, and much 
more of the same kind, which I cannot remember, he and his 
companion got up and walked away; and presently I and Sylvester 
got up and walked to our camp; and there I lay down in my tent by
the side of my wife, where I had an ugly dream of having camped 
upon an iron road; my tent being overturned by a flying vehicle; 
my wife&rsquo;s leg injured; and all my affairs put into great 
confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I have 
braided your hair in our fashion: you look very beautiful, madam;
more beautiful, if possible, than before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle now 
rose, and came forward with her tire-woman.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro 
was loud in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did not think
Belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the 
ministry of Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Nature never 
intended Belle to appear as a gypsy; she had made her too proud 
and serious.&nbsp; A more proper part for her was that of a 
heroine, a queenly heroine,&mdash;that of Theresa of Hungary, for
example; or, better still, that of Brynhilda the Valkyrie, the 
beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer, who incurred the curse of 
Odin, because, in the tumult of spears, she sided with the young 
king, and doomed the old warrior to die, to whom Odin had 
promised victory.</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment in silence; then turning to 
Mrs. Petulengro, she said, &ldquo;You have had your will with me;
are you satisfied?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so, madam,&rdquo; 
said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;and I hope you will be so too, as 
soon as you have looked in the glass.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
looked in one already,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and the glass 
does not flatter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean the face of the 
young rye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;never mind him, 
madam; the young rye, though he knows a thing or two, is not a 
university, nor a person of universal wisdom.&nbsp; I assure you 
that you never looked so well before; and I hope that, from this 
moment, you will wear your hair in this way.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And who is to braid it in this way?&rdquo; said Belle, 
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, 
&ldquo;I will braid it for you every morning, if you will <!-- 
page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>but be pursuaded to join us.&nbsp; Do so, madam, and I 
think, if you did, the young rye would do so too.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The young rye is nothing to me, nor I to him,&rdquo; said 
Belle; &ldquo;we have stayed some time together; but our paths 
will soon be apart.&nbsp; Now, farewell, for I am about to take a
journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you will go out with your hair 
as I have braided it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;if you 
do, everybody will be in love with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;hitherto I have allowed you 
to do what you please, but henceforth I shall have my own 
way.&nbsp; Come, come,&rdquo; said she, observing that the gypsy 
was about to speak, &ldquo;we have had enough of nonsense; 
whenever I leave this hollow, it will be wearing my hair in my 
own fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, wife,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro, &ldquo;we will no longer intrude upon the rye and 
rawnie, there is such a thing as being troublesome.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Thereupon Mr. Petulengro and his wife took their leave, with many
salutations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you are going?&rdquo; said I, when
Belle and I were left alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;I am going on a journey; my affairs compel 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you will return again?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I shall return 
once more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;what do you mean by once more?&nbsp; The Petulengros will 
soon be gone, and will you abandon me in this place?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were alone here,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;before I 
came, and, I suppose, found it agreeable, or you would not have 
stayed in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
was before I knew you; but having lived with you here, I should 
be very loth to live here without you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I did not know that I 
was of so much consequence to you.&nbsp; Well, the day is wearing
away&mdash;I must go and harness Traveller to the 
cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do that,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;or anything else you may wish me.&nbsp; Go and prepare 
yourself; I will see after Traveller and the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Belle departed to her tent, and I set about performing the task I
had undertaken.&nbsp; In about half-an-hour Belle again made her 
appearance&mdash;she was dressed neatly and plainly.&nbsp; Her 
hair was no longer in the Roman fashion, in which Pakomovna had 
plaited it, but was secured by a comb; she held a bonnet in her 
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there anything else I can do for 
you?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are two or three 
bundles by my tent, which you can put into the cart,&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; I put the bundles into the cart, and then led 
Traveller and the cart up the winding path, to the mouth of the 
dingle, near which was Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; 
Belle followed.&nbsp; At the top, I delivered the reins into her 
hands; we looked at each other steadfastly for some time.&nbsp; 
Belle then <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>departed and I returned to the 
dingle, where, seating myself on my stone, I remained for upwards
of an hour in thought.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>THE FESTIVAL&mdash;THE GYPSY SONG&mdash;PIRAMUS OF 
ROME&mdash;THE SCOTCHMAN&mdash;GYPSY NAMES.</p>
<p>On the following day there was much feasting amongst the 
Romany chals of Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Throughout 
the forenoon the Romany chies did scarcely anything but cook 
flesh, and the flesh which they cooked was swine&rsquo;s 
flesh.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock, the chals and chies 
dividing themselves into various parties, sat down and partook of
the fare, which was partly roasted, partly sodden.&nbsp; I dined 
that day with Mr. Petulengro and his wife and family, Ursula, Mr.
and Mrs. Chikno, and Sylvester and his two children.&nbsp; 
Sylvester, it will be as well to say, was a widower, and had 
consequently no one to cook his victuals for him, supposing he 
had any, which was not always the case, Sylvester&rsquo;s affairs
being seldom in a prosperous state.&nbsp; He was noted for his 
bad success in trafficking, notwithstanding the many hints which 
he received from Jasper, under whose protection he had placed 
himself, even as Tawno Chikno had done, who himself, as the 
reader has heard on a former occasion, was anything but a wealthy
subject, though he was at all times better off than Sylvester, 
the Lazarus of the Romany tribe.</p>
<p>All our party ate with a good appetite, except myself, who, 
feeling rather melancholy that day, had little desire to 
eat.&nbsp; I did not, like the others, partake of the pork, but 
got my dinner entirely off the body of a squirrel which had been 
shot the day before by a chal of the name of Piramus, who, 
besides being a good shot, was celebrated for his skill in 
playing on the fiddle.&nbsp; During the dinner a horn filled with
ale passed frequently around, I drank of it more than once, and 
felt inspirited by the draughts.&nbsp; The repast concluded, 
Sylvester and his children departed to their tent, and Mr. 
Petulengro, Tawno, and myself getting up, went and lay down under
a shady hedge, where Mr. Petulengro, lighting his pipe, began to 
smoke, and where Tawno presently fell asleep.&nbsp; I was about 
to fall asleep also, when I heard the sound of music and 
song.&nbsp; <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Piramus was playing on the fiddle, 
whilst Mrs. Chikno, who had a voice of her own, was singing in 
tones sharp enough, but of great power, a gypsy song:&mdash;</p>
<h3>POISONING THE PORKER.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Mrs. Chikno</span>.</h3>

</blockquote>
<p>Which song I had translated in the following manner, in my 
younger days, for a lady&rsquo;s album.</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to me ye Roman lads, who are seated in the 
straw about the fire, and I will tell how we poison the porker, I
will tell how we poison the porker.</p>
<p>We go to the house of the poison monger, <a 
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42" 
class="citation">[42]</a> where we buy three pennies&rsquo; worth
of bane, and when we return to our people we say, we will poison 
the porker; we will try and poison the porker.</p>
<p>We then make up the poison, and then we take our way to the 
house of the farmer, as if to beg a bit of victuals, a little 
broken victuals.</p>
<p>We see a jolly porker, and then we say in Roman language, 
&ldquo;Fling the bane yonder amongst the dirt, and the porker 
soon will find it, the porker soon will find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on the morrow, we will return to the farm-house, and beg
the dead porker, the body of the dead porker.</p>
<p>And so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the 
night; on the morrow we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the
porker.</p>
<p>And then we wash the inside well, till all the inside is 
perfectly clean, till there&rsquo;s no bane within it, not a 
poison grain within it.</p>
<p>And then we roast the body well, send for ale to the alehouse,
and have a merry banquet, a merry Roman banquet.</p>
<p>The fellow with the fiddle plays, he plays; the little lassie 
sings, she sings an ancient Roman ditty; now hear the Roman 
ditty.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SONG OF THE BROKEN CHASTITY.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Ursula</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Penn&rsquo;d the Romany chi k&eacute; laki dye<br 
/>
&ldquo;Miry dearie dye mi shom cambri!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And savo kair&rsquo;d tute cambri,<br />

<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kernel in those songs, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, when the songs and music 
were over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are certainly very 
remarkable songs.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, I hope you have not been 
drabbing baulor lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose we have, brother, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is a very dangerous practice, to say nothing of
the wickedness of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity has no law, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have always said 
so, but you are not necessitous, and should not drab 
baulor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who told you we had been drabbing 
baulor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have had a banquet of pork, and after the 
banquet Mrs. Chikno sang a song about drabbing baulor, so I 
naturally thought you might have lately been engaged in such a 
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, you occasionally utter a word or two of common
sense.&nbsp; It was natural for you to suppose, after seeing that
dinner of pork, and hearing that song, that we had been drabbing 
baulor; I will now tell you that we have not been doing so.&nbsp;
What have you to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found
that it was sweet and tasty, which balluva that is drabbed can 
hardly be expected to be.&nbsp; We have no reason to drab baulor 
at present, we have money and credit; but necessity has no 
law.&nbsp; Our forefathers occasionally drabbed baulor, some of 
our people may still do such a thing, but only from 
compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and at your merry meetings
you sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people, alias 
their villainous actions; and, after all, what would the stirring
poetry of any nation be, but for its compulsatory deeds?&nbsp; 
Look at the poetry of Scotland, the heroic part, founded almost 
entirely on <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the villainous deeds of the Scotch 
nation; cow-stealing, for example, which is very little better 
than drabbing baulor; whilst the softer part is mostly about the 
slips of its females among the broom, so that no upholder of 
Scotch poetry could censure Ursula&rsquo;s song as indelicate, 
even if he understood it.&nbsp; What do you think, 
Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, brother, as I before said, that occasionally 
you utter a word of common sense; you were talking of the Scotch,
brother; what do you think of a Scotchman finding fault with 
Romany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Scotchman finding fault with Romany, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh
dear, but you joke, the thing could never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle; what do you think 
of a Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s 
fiddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s 
fiddle! nonsense, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I most dislike, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, unless it be the constable, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the constable, it&rsquo;s a beggar on 
horseback, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a beggar on horseback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a scamp, brother, raised above his proper place, 
who takes every opportunity of giving himself fine airs.&nbsp; 
About a week ago, my people and myself camped on a green by a 
plantation in the neighbourhood of a great house.&nbsp; In the 
evening we were making merry, the girls were dancing, while 
Piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his own composing, to
which he has given his own name, Piramus of Rome, and which is 
much celebrated amongst our people, and from which I have been 
told that one of the grand gorgio composers, who once heard it, 
has taken several hints.&nbsp; So, as we were making merry, a 
great many grand people, lords and ladies, I believe, came from 
the great house and looked on, as the girls danced to the tune of
Piramus of Rome, and seemed much pleased; and when the girls had 
left off dancing, and Piramus playing, the ladies wanted to have 
their fortunes told; so I bade Mikailia Chikno, who can tell a 
fortune when she pleases better than any one else, tell them a 
fortune, and she, being in a good mind, told them a fortune which
pleased them very much.&nbsp; So, after they had heard their 
fortunes, one of them asked if any of our women could sing; and I
told them several could, more particularly Leviathan&mdash;you 
know Leviathan, she is not here now, but some miles distant, she 
is our best singer, Ursula <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>coming 
next.&nbsp; So the lady said she should like to hear Leviathan 
sing, whereupon Leviathan sang the Gudlo pesham, and Piramus 
played the tune of the same name, which, as you know, means the 
honeycomb, the song and the tune being well entitled to the name,
being wonderfully sweet.&nbsp; Well, everybody present seemed 
mighty well pleased with the song and music, with the exception 
of one person, a carroty-haired Scotch body; how he came there I 
don&rsquo;t know, but there he was; and, coming forward, he began
in Scotch as broad as a barn-door to find fault with the music 
and the song, saying that he had never heard viler stuff than 
either.&nbsp; Well, brother, out of consideration for the civil 
gentry with whom the fellow had come, I held my peace for a long 
time, and in order to get the subject changed, I said to Mikailia
in Romany, you have told the ladies their fortunes, now tell the 
gentlemen theirs, quick, quick,&mdash;pen lende dukkerin.&nbsp; 
Well, brother, the Scotchman, I suppose, thinking I was speaking 
ill of him, fell into a greater passion than before, and catching
hold of the word dukkerin&mdash;&lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said he, 
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s dukkerin?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is fortune, a man or 
woman&rsquo;s destiny; don&rsquo;t you like the 
word?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Word! d&rsquo;ye ca&rsquo; that a word?
a bonnie word,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll 
tell us what it is in Scotch,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;in order that
we may improve our language by a Scotch word; a pal of mine has 
told me that we have taken a great many words from foreign 
lingos.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, then, if that be the case, 
fellow, I will tell you; it is e&rsquo;en 
&ldquo;spaeing,&rdquo;&rsquo; said he, very seriously.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my own 
word, which is much the prettiest&mdash;spaeing! spaeing! why, I 
should be ashamed to make use of the word, it sounds so much like
a certain other word;&rsquo; and then I made a face as if I were 
unwell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Scotch also for 
that?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you mean by speaking in that 
guise to a gentleman?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you insolent 
vagabond without a name or a country.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There 
you are mistaken,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my country is Egypt, but 
we &rsquo;Gyptians, like you Scotch, are rather fond of 
travelling; and as for name&mdash;my name is Jasper Petulengro, 
perhaps you have a better; what is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sandy 
Macraw.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that, brother, the gentlemen burst into a
roar of laughter, and all the ladies tittered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rather severe on the Scotchman, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, brother, and suppose I were, he began 
first; I am the civilest man in the world, and never interfere 
with anybody who lets me and mine alone.&nbsp; He finds fault 
with <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Romany, forsooth! why, L---d A&rsquo;mighty, 
what&rsquo;s Scotch?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like our songs; what 
are his own?&nbsp; I understand them as little as he mine; I have
heard one or two of them, and pretty rubbish they seemed.&nbsp; 
But the best of the joke is the fellow&rsquo;s finding fault with
Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle&mdash;a chap from the land of bagpipes 
finding fault with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll 
back that fiddle against all the bagpipes in Scotland, and 
Piramus against all the bagpipers; for though Piramus weighs but 
ten stone, he shall flog a Scotchman of twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotchmen are never so fat as that,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;unless, indeed, they have been a long time pensioners of 
England.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, what remarkable names your people 
have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what pretty names, brother; there&rsquo;s my own, 
for example, Jasper; then there&rsquo;s Ambrose and Sylvester; 
then there&rsquo;s Culvato, which signifies Claude; then 
there&rsquo;s Piramus, that&rsquo;s a nice name, 
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s name, Pakomovna; 
then there&rsquo;s Ursula and Morella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, brother, there&rsquo;s Ercilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ercilla! the name of the great poet of Spain, how 
wonderful; then Leviathan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of a ship, brother; Leviathan was named after 
a ship, so don&rsquo;t make a wonder out of her.&nbsp; But 
there&rsquo;s Sanpriel and Synfye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and Clementina and Lavinia, Camillia and Lydia, 
Curlanda and Orlanda; wherever did they get those 
names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did my wife get her necklace, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows best, Jasper.&nbsp; I hope . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, no hoping!&nbsp; She got it from her grandmother,
who died at the age of a hundred and three, and sleeps in 
Coggeshall churchyard.&nbsp; She got it from her mother, who also
died very old, and who could give no other account of it than 
that it had been in the family time out of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence could they have got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, perhaps where they got their names, brother.&nbsp;
A gentleman, who had travelled much, once told me that he had 
seen the sister of it about the neck of an Indian 
queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of your names, Jasper, appear to be church names; 
your own, for example, and Ambrose, and Sylvester; perhaps you 
got them from the Papists, in the times of Popery; but where did 
you get such a name as Piramus, a name of Grecian romance?&nbsp; 
Then some of them appear to be Slavonian; for <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>example, 
Mikailia and Pakomovna.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much of 
Slavonian; but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Slavonian, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family name of certain nations, the principal of 
which is the Russian, and from which the word slave is originally
derived.&nbsp; You have heard of the Russians, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; and seen some.&nbsp; I saw their crallis 
at the time of the peace; he was not a bad-looking man for a 
Russian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Jasper, I&rsquo;m half inclined to think 
that crallis is a Slavish word.&nbsp; I saw something like it in 
a lil called &lsquo;Voltaire&rsquo;s Life of 
Charles.&rsquo;&nbsp; How you should have come by such names and 
words is to me incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem posed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really know very little about you, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, brother.&nbsp; We know very little 
about ourselves; and you know nothing, save what we have told 
you; and we have now and then told you things about us which are 
not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you, brother.&nbsp; 
You will say that was wrong, perhaps it was.&nbsp; Well, Sunday 
will be here in a day or two, when we will go to church, where 
possibly we shall hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of
lying.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<blockquote><p>THE CHURCH&mdash;THE ARISTOCRATICAL PEW&mdash;DAYS
OF YORE&mdash;THE CLERGYMAN&mdash;&ldquo;IN WHAT WOULD A MAN BE 
PROFITED?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When two days had passed, Sunday came; I breakfasted by myself
in the solitary dingle; and then, having set things a little to 
rights, I ascended to Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; I 
could hear church-bells ringing around in the distance, appearing
to say, &ldquo;Come to church, come to church,&rdquo; as clearly 
as it was possible for church-bells to say.&nbsp; I found Mr. 
Petulengro seated by the door of his tent, smoking his pipe, in 
rather an ungenteel undress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Jasper,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;are you ready to go to church; for if you are, I 
am ready to accompany you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not ready, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;nor is my wife; the 
church, too, to which we shall go is three miles off; so it is of
no use to think of going <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>there this 
morning, as the service would be three-quarters over before we 
got there; if, however, you are disposed to go in the afternoon, 
we are your people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I returned to my 
dingle, where I passed several hours in conning the Welsh Bible, 
which the preacher, Peter Williams, had given me.</p>
<p>At last I gave over reading, took a slight refreshment, and 
was about to emerge from the dingle, when I heard the voice of 
Mr. Petulengro calling me.&nbsp; I went up again to the 
encampment, where I found Mr. Petulengro, his wife, and Tawno 
Chikno, ready to proceed to church.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro
were dressed in Roman fashion, though not in the full-blown 
manner in which they had paid their visit to Isopel and 
myself.&nbsp; Tawno had on a clean white slop, with a nearly new 
black beaver, with very broad rims, and the nap exceedingly 
long.&nbsp; As for myself, I was dressed in much the same manner 
as that in which I departed from London, having on, in honour of 
the day, a shirt perfectly clean, having washed one on purpose 
for the occasion, with my own hands, the day before, in the pond 
of tepid water in which the newts and efts were in the habit of 
taking their pleasure.&nbsp; We proceeded for upwards of a mile, 
by footpaths through meadows and corn-fields; we crossed various 
stiles; at last, passing over one, we found ourselves in a road, 
wending along which for a considerable distance, we at last came 
in sight of a church, the bells of which had been tolling 
distinctly in our ears for some time; before, however, we reached
the churchyard the bells had ceased their melody.&nbsp; It was 
surrounded by lofty beech trees of brilliant green foliage.&nbsp;
We entered the gate, Mrs. Petulengro leading the way, and 
proceeded to a small door near the east end of the church.&nbsp; 
As we advanced, the sound of singing within the church rose upon 
our ears.&nbsp; Arrived at the small door, Mrs. Petulengro opened
it and entered, followed by Tawno Chikno.&nbsp; I myself went 
last of all, following Mr. Petulengro, who, before I entered, 
turned round and, with a significant nod, advised me to take care
how I behaved.&nbsp; The part of the church which we had entered 
was the chancel; on one side stood a number of venerable old 
men&mdash;probably the neighbouring poor&mdash;and on the other a
number of poor girls belonging to the village school, dressed in 
white gowns and straw bonnets, whom two elegant but simply 
dressed young women were superintending.&nbsp; Every voice seemed
to be united in singing a certain anthem, which, notwithstanding 
it was written neither by Tate nor <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Brady, 
contains some of the sublimest words which were ever put 
together, not the worst of which are those which burst on our 
ears as we entered.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every eye shall now behold Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Robed in dreadful majesty;<br />
Those who set at nought and sold Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply wailing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the true Messiah 
see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still following Mrs. Petulengro, we proceeded down the chancel
and along the aisle; notwithstanding the singing, I could 
distinctly hear as we passed many a voice whispering, &ldquo;Here
come the gypsies! here come the gypsies!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt 
rather embarrassed, with a somewhat awkward doubt as to where we 
were to sit; none of the occupiers of the pews, who appeared to 
consist almost entirely of farmers, with their wives, sons, and 
daughters, opened a door to admit us.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro, 
however, appeared to feel not the least embarrassment, but 
tripped along the aisle with the greatest nonchalance.&nbsp; We 
passed under the pulpit, in which stood the clergyman in his 
white surplice, and reached the middle of the church, where we 
were confronted by the sexton dressed in long blue coat, and 
holding in his hand a wand.&nbsp; This functionary motioned 
towards the lower end of the church where were certain benches, 
partly occupied by poor people and boys.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro, 
however, with a toss of her head, directed her course to a 
magnificent pew, which was unoccupied, which she opened and 
entered, followed closely by Tawno Chikno, Mr. Petulengro, and 
myself.&nbsp; The sexton did not appear by any means to approve 
of the arrangement, and as I stood next the door laid his finger 
on my arm, as if to intimate that myself and companions must quit
our aristocratical location.&nbsp; I said nothing, but directed 
my eyes to the clergyman, who uttered a short and expressive 
cough; the sexton looked at him for a moment, and then, bowing 
his head, closed the door&mdash;in a moment more the music 
ceased.&nbsp; I took up a prayer-book, on which was engraved an 
earl&rsquo;s coronet.&nbsp; The clergyman uttered, &ldquo;I will 
arise, and go to my father.&rdquo;&nbsp; England&rsquo;s sublime 
liturgy had commenced.</p>
<p>Oh, what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an 
edifice devoted to the religion of my country!&nbsp; I had not 
been <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>in such a place I cannot tell for how 
long&mdash;certainly not for years; and now I had found my way 
there again, it appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew of 
the old church of pretty D . . .&nbsp; I had occasionally done so
when a child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes, surely I had 
been asleep and had woken up; but, no! alas, no!&nbsp; I had not 
been asleep&mdash;at least not in the old church&mdash;if I had 
been asleep I had been walking in my sleep, struggling, striving,
learning, and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away
whilst I had been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit
had come on whilst I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had 
altered, and above all myself, whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp; 
No, I had not been asleep in the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew
it is true, but not the pew of black leather, in which I 
sometimes fell asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and 
then my companions, they were no longer those of days of 
yore.&nbsp; I was no longer with my respectable father and 
mother, and my dear brother, but with the gypsy cral and his 
wife, and the gigantic Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky 
people.&nbsp; And what was I myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent 
child, but a moody man, bearing in my face, as I knew well, the 
marks of my strivings and strugglings, of what I had learned and 
unlearned; nevertheless, the general aspect of things brought to 
my mind what I had felt and seen of yore.&nbsp; There was 
difference enough it is true, but still there was a 
similarity&mdash;at least I thought so,&mdash;the church, the 
clergyman, and the clerk differing in many respects from those of
pretty D . . ., put me strangely in mind of them; and then the 
words!&mdash;by-the-bye, was it not the magic of the words which 
brought the dear enchanting past so powerfully before the mind of
Lavengro? for the words were the same sonorous words of high 
import which had first made an impression on his childish ear in 
the old church of pretty D . . .</p>
<p>The liturgy was now over, during the reading of which my 
companions behaved in a most unexceptional manner, sitting down 
and rising up when other people sat down and rose, and holding in
their hands prayer-books which they found in the pew, into which 
they stared intently, though I observed that, with the exception 
of Mrs. Petulengro, who knew how to read a little, they held the 
books by the top, and not the bottom, as is the usual way.&nbsp; 
The clergyman now ascended the pulpit, arrayed in his black 
gown.&nbsp; The congregation composed themselves to attention, as
did also my companions, who fixed their <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>eyes upon the
clergyman with a certain strange immovable stare, which I believe
to be peculiar to their race.&nbsp; The clergyman gave out his 
text, and began to preach.&nbsp; He was a tall, gentlemanly man, 
seemingly between fifty and sixty, with greyish hair; his 
features were very handsome, but with a somewhat melancholy cast:
the tones of his voice were rich and noble, but also with 
somewhat of melancholy in them.&nbsp; The text which he gave out 
was the following one, &ldquo;In what would a man be profited, 
provided he gained the whole world, and lost his own 
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on this text the clergyman preached long and well: he did 
not read his sermon, but spoke it extempore; his doing so rather 
surprised and offended me at first; I was not used to such a 
style of preaching in a church devoted to the religion of my 
country.&nbsp; I compared it within my mind with the style of 
preaching used by the high-church rector in the old church of 
pretty D . . ., and I thought to myself it was very different, 
and being very different I did not like it, and I thought to 
myself how scandalised the people of D . . . would have been had 
they heard it, and I figured to myself how indignant the 
high-church clerk would have been had any clergyman got up in the
church of D . . . and preached in such a manner.&nbsp; Did it not
savour strongly of dissent, methodism, and similar low 
stuff?&nbsp; Surely it did; why, the Methodist I had heard preach
on the heath above the old city, preached in the same 
manner&mdash;at least he preached extempore; ay, and something 
like the present clergyman, for the Methodist spoke very 
zealously and with great feeling, and so did the present 
clergyman; so I, of course, felt rather offended with the 
clergyman for speaking with zeal and feeling.&nbsp; However, long
before the sermon was over I forgot the offence which I had 
taken, and listened to the sermon with much admiration, for the 
eloquence and powerful reasoning with which it abounded.</p>
<p>Oh, how eloquent he was, when he talked of the inestimable 
value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which he said endured for ever, 
whilst his body, as every one knew, lasted at most for a very 
contemptible period of time; and how forcibly he reasoned on the 
folly of a man, who, for the sake of gaining the whole 
world&mdash;a thing, he said, which provided he gained he could 
only possess for a part of the time, during which his perishable 
body existed&mdash;should lose his soul, that is, cause that 
precious deathless portion of him to suffer indescribable misery 
time without end.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>There was one part of his sermon which struck me in a 
very particular manner: he said, &ldquo;That there were some 
people who gained something in return for their souls; if they 
did not get the whole world, they got a part of it&mdash;lands, 
wealth, honour, or renown; mere trifles, he allowed, in 
comparison with the value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which is 
destined either to enjoy delight, or suffer tribulation time 
without end; but which, in the eyes of the worldly, had a certain
value, and which afforded a certain pleasure and 
satisfaction.&nbsp; But there were also others who lost their 
souls, and got nothing for them&mdash;neither lands, wealth, 
renown, nor consideration, who were poor outcasts, and despised 
by everybody.&nbsp; My friends,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if the 
man is a fool who barters his soul for the whole world, what a 
fool he must be who barters his soul for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the clergyman, as he uttered these words, wandered
around the whole congregation; and when he had concluded them, 
the eyes of the whole congregation were turned upon my companions
and myself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>RETURN FROM CHURCH&mdash;THE CUCKOO AND GYPSY&mdash;SPIRITUAL 
DISCOURSE.</p>
<p>The service over, my companions and myself returned towards 
the encampment by the way we came.&nbsp; Some of the humble part 
of the congregation laughed and joked at us as we passed.&nbsp; 
Mr. Petulengro and his wife, however, returned their laughs and 
jokes with interest.&nbsp; As for Tawno and myself, we said 
nothing: Tawno, like most handsome fellows, having very little to
say for himself at any time; and myself, though not handsome, not
being particularly skilful at repartee.&nbsp; Some boys followed 
us for a considerable time, making all kinds of observations 
about gypsies; but as we walked at a great pace, we gradually 
left them behind, and at last lost sight of them.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Petulengro and Tawno Chikno walked together, even as they had 
come; whilst Mr. Petulengro and myself followed at a little 
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very fine preacher we heard,&rdquo; said I 
to Mr. Petulengro, after we had crossed the stile into the 
fields.</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>&ldquo;Very fine, indeed, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro; &ldquo;he is talked of far and wide, for his sermons;
folks say that there is scarcely another like him in the whole of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks rather melancholy, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lost his wife several years ago, who, they say, was 
one of the most beautiful women ever seen.&nbsp; They say that it
was grief for her loss that made him come out mighty strong as a 
preacher; for, though he was a clergyman, he was never heard of 
in the pulpit before he lost his wife; since then the whole 
country has rung with the preaching of the clergyman of M . . ., 
as they call him.&nbsp; Those two nice young gentlewomen, whom 
you saw with the female childer, are his daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know all about him, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you 
ever hear him preach before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; but he has frequently been to our tent,
and his daughters too, and given us tracts; for he is one of the 
people they call Evangelicals, who give folks tracts which they 
cannot read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should learn to read, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no time, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not frequently idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; when we are not engaged in our traffic,
we are engaged in taking our relaxation: so we have no time to 
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should make an effort.&nbsp; If you were 
disposed to learn to read, I would endeavour to assist you.&nbsp;
You would be all the better for knowing how to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you could read the Scriptures, and, by so doing, 
learn your duty towards your fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that already, brother; the constables and 
justices have contrived to knock that tolerably into our 
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you frequently break the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I believe, do now and then those who know how to 
read, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to 
read, as, by so doing, you might learn your duty towards 
yourselves: and your chief duty is to take care of your own 
souls; did not the preacher say, &lsquo;In what is a man 
profited, provided he gain the whole world&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not much of the world, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>&ldquo;Very little indeed, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you not 
observe how the eyes of the whole congregation were turned 
towards our pew when the preacher said, &lsquo;There are some 
people who lose their souls, and get nothing in exchange; who are
outcast, despised, and miserable&rsquo;?&nbsp; Now, was not what 
he said quite applicable to the gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not miserable, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you ought to be, Jasper.&nbsp; Have you an 
inch of ground of your own?&nbsp; Are you of the least use?&nbsp;
Are you not spoken ill of by everybody?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a 
gypsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bird noising yonder, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird!&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s the cuckoo tolling; 
but what has the cuckoo to do with the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, brother; what&rsquo;s the 
cuckoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? you know as much about it as myself, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a kind of roguish, chaffing bird, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows whence it comes, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poor, brother, not a nest of its own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With every person&rsquo;s bad word, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper, every person is mocking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolerably merry, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tolerably merry, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not exactly, Jasper; the cuckoo is a pleasant, 
funny bird, and its presence and voice give a great charm to the 
green trees and fields; no, I can&rsquo;t say I wish exactly to 
get rid of the cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, what&rsquo;s a Romany chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer that question yourself, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A roguish, chaffing fellow, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, Jasper; I see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something very much like a cuckoo, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are after, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to get rid of us, wouldn&rsquo;t 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>&ldquo;We are no ornament to the green lanes in spring 
and summer time are we, brother? and the voices of our chies, 
with their cukkerin and dukkerin, don&rsquo;t help to make them 
pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are at, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door 
fowls, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I should, Jasper, whatever some people 
might wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chals and chies into radical weavers and 
factory wenches, hey, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I should, Jasper.&nbsp; You are 
certainly a picturesque people, and in many respects an ornament 
both to town and country; painting and lil writing too are under 
great obligations to you.&nbsp; What pretty pictures are made out
of your campings and groupings, and what pretty books have been 
written in which gypsies, or at least creatures intended to 
represent gypsies, have been the principal figures!&nbsp; I think
if we were without you, we should begin to miss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all 
converted into barn-door fowls.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, 
frequently as I have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time, 
and heard the cuckoo, I have thought that we chals and cuckoos 
are alike in many respects, but especially in character.&nbsp; 
Everybody speaks ill of us both, and everybody is glad to see 
both of us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men 
and cuckoos; men have souls, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not cuckoos, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little 
short of blasphemy.&nbsp; How should a bird have a 
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how should a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you take your oath of it, brother&mdash;your 
bodily oath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think I might, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the soul, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could you swear to it?&nbsp; A pretty figure 
you would make in a court of justice, to swear to a thing which 
you never saw.&nbsp; Hold up your head, fellow.&nbsp; When and 
where did you see it?&nbsp; Now upon your oath, fellow, do you 
mean to say <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>that this Roman stole the 
donkey&rsquo;s foal?&nbsp; Oh, there&rsquo;s no one for 
cross-questioning like Counsellor P . . .&nbsp; Our people when 
they are in a hobble always like to employ him, though he is 
somewhat dear.&nbsp; Now, brother, how can you get over the 
&lsquo;upon your oath, fellow, will you say that you have a 
soul?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will take no oaths on the subject; but you 
yourself believe in the soul.&nbsp; I have heard you say that you
believe in dukkerin; now what is dukkerin but the soul 
science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did I say that I believed in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, after that fight, when you pointed to the bloody 
mark in the cloud, whilst he you wot of was galloping in the 
barouche to the old town, amidst the rain-cataracts, the thunder,
and flame of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some kind of remembrance of it, 
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again, I heard you say that the dook of Abershaw 
rode every night on horseback down the wooded hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother, what a wonderful memory you 
have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had not, Jasper, but I can&rsquo;t help it; it
is my misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misfortune! well, perhaps it is; at any rate it is very
ungenteel to have such a memory.&nbsp; I have heard my wife say 
that to show you have a long memory looks very vulgar; and that 
you can&rsquo;t give a greater proof of gentility than by 
forgetting a thing as soon as possible&mdash;more especially a 
promise, or an acquaintance when he happens to be shabby.&nbsp; 
Well, brother, I don&rsquo;t deny that I may have said that I 
believe in dukkerin, and in Abershaw&rsquo;s dook, which you say 
is his soul; but what I believe one moment, or say I believe, 
don&rsquo;t be certain that I shall believe the next, or say I 
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Jasper, I heard you say on a previous occasion,
on quoting a piece of a song, that when a man dies he is cast 
into the earth, and there&rsquo;s an end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, did I?&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, what a memory you have,
brother!&nbsp; But you are not sure that I hold that opinion 
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Jasper.&nbsp; Indeed, after such a 
sermon as we have been hearing, I should be very shocked if you 
held such an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, brother, don&rsquo;t be sure I do not, however
shocking such an opinion may be to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an incomprehensible people you are, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are rather so, brother; indeed, we have posed wiser 
heads than yours before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>&ldquo;You seem to care for so little, and yet you rove 
about a distinct race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of our women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have certainly very singular names, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names!&nbsp; Lavengro!&nbsp; But, brother, if you had 
been as fond of things as of names, you would never have been a 
pal of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they rum animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have tongues of their own, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever feel their teeth and nails, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Jasper, save Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have 
always been very civil to them, so . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They let you alone.&nbsp; I say, brother, some part of 
the secret is in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem rather flighty, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather fond of loose discourse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you always trust them, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never watch them, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they always trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so well as we can them.&nbsp; However, we get
on very well together, except Mikailia and her husband; but 
Mikailia is a cripple, and is married to the beauty of the world,
so she may be expected to be jealous&mdash;though he would not 
part with her for a duchess, no more than I would part with my 
rawnie, nor any other chal with his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but would not the chi part with the chal for a 
duke, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pakomovna gave up the duke for me, 
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she occasionally talks of him, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, but Pakomovna was born on a common not 
far from the sign of the gammon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gammon of bacon, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; but gammon likewise means . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it does, Jasper; it means fun, ridicule, jest; 
it is an ancient Norse word, and is found in the Edda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how learned in lils you 
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many words of Norse are to be found in our vulgar 
sayings, Jasper; for example&mdash;in that particularly vulgar 
saying of ours, <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>&lsquo;Your mother is up,&rsquo; 
there&rsquo;s a noble Norse word; mother, there, meaning not the 
female who bore us, but rage and choler, as I discovered by 
reading the Sagas, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how book-learned you 
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifferently so, Jasper.&nbsp; Then you think you 
might trust your wife with the duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could, brother, or even with 
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh, I never troubled my head 
about your wife; but I suppose there have been love affairs 
between gorgios and Romany chies.&nbsp; Why, novels are stuffed 
with such matters; and then even one of your own songs says 
so&mdash;the song which Ursula was singing the other 
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is somewhat of an old song, brother, and is sung 
by the chies as a warning at our solemn festivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but there&rsquo;s your sister-in-law, Ursula, 
herself, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ursula, herself, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of my having her, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, why didn&rsquo;t you have 
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she have had me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother.&nbsp; You are so much of a Roman, 
and speak Romany so remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! she looks very innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so, brother!&nbsp; However, though not born 
on the same common with my wife, she knows a thing or two of 
Roman matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to ask her a question or two, Jasper, in 
connection with that song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do no better, brother.&nbsp; Here we are at the
camp.&nbsp; After tea, take Ursula under a hedge, and ask her a 
question or two in connection with that song.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>SUNDAY EVENING&mdash;URSULA&mdash;ACTION AT 
LAW&mdash;MERIDIANA&mdash;MARRIED ALREADY.</p>
<p>I took tea that evening with Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro and 
Ursula, outside of their tent.&nbsp; Tawno was not present, being
engaged with his wife in his own tabernacle; Sylvester was there,
however, lolling listlessly upon the ground.&nbsp; As I looked 
upon this man, I thought him one of the most disagreeable <!--

59</span>fellows I had ever seen.&nbsp; His features were ugly, 
and, moreover, as dark as pepper; and, besides being dark, his 
skin was dirty.&nbsp; As for his dress, it was torn and 
sordid.&nbsp; His chest was broad, and his arms seemed powerful; 
but, upon the whole, he looked a very caitiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am 
sorry that man has lost his wife,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;for I 
am sure he will never get another.&rdquo;&nbsp; What surprises me
is, that he ever found a woman disposed to unite her lot with 
his!</p>
<p>After tea I got up and strolled about the field.&nbsp; My 
thoughts were upon Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I wondered where she 
was, and how long she would stay away.&nbsp; At length becoming 
tired and listless, I determined to return to the dingle, and 
resume the reading of the Bible at the place where I had left 
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;What better could I do,&rdquo; methought, 
&ldquo;on a Sunday evening?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was then near the wood
which surrounded the dingle, but at that side which was farthest 
from the encampment, which stood near the entrance.&nbsp; 
Suddenly, on turning round the southern corner of the copse, 
which surrounded the dingle, I perceived Ursula seated under a 
thorn-bush.&nbsp; I thought I never saw her look prettier than 
then, dressed as she was, in her Sunday&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Ursula,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I little 
thought to have the pleasure of seeing you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would you, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;had 
not Jasper told me that you had been talking about me, and wanted
to speak to me under a hedge; so, hearing that, I watched your 
motions, and came here and sat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle, 
to read the Bible, Ursula, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray then, go to your quarters, brother, and read 
the Miduveleskoe lil; you can speak to me under a hedge some 
other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will sit down with you, Ursula; for, after 
all, reading godly books in dingles at eve is rather sombre 
work.&nbsp; Yes, I think I will sit down with you;&rdquo; and I 
sat down by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, now you have sat down with me under the 
hedge, what have you to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I hardly know, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know, brother; a pretty fellow you to ask young 
women to come and sit with you under hedges, and, when they come,
not know what to say to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ah! I remember; do you know, Ursula, that I take a 
great interest in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>&ldquo;Thank ye, brother; kind of you, at any 
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be exposed to a great many temptations, 
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many indeed, brother.&nbsp; It is hard to see 
fine things, such as shawls, gold watches, and chains in the 
shops, behind the big glasses, and to know that they are not 
intended for one.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have been tempted
to make a dash at them; but I bethought myself that by so doing I
should cut my hands, besides being almost certain of being 
grabbed and sent across the gull&rsquo;s bath to the foreign 
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think gold and fine things temptations, 
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother, very great temptations; don&rsquo;t
you think them so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then more fool you, brother; but have the kindness to 
tell me what you would call a temptation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for example, the hope of honour and renown, 
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hope of honour and renown! very good, brother; but 
I tell you one thing, that unless you have money in your pocket, 
and good broadcloth on your back, you are not likely to obtain 
much honour and&mdash;what do you call it? amongst the gorgios, 
to say nothing of the Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought, Ursula, that the Romany chals, 
roaming about the world as they do, free and independent, were 
above being led by such trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know nothing of the gypsies, brother; no 
people on earth are fonder of those trifles, as you call them, 
than the Romany chals, or more disposed to respect those who have
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then money and fine clothes would induce you to do 
anything, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To chore, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; gypsies have been transported 
before now for choring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hokkawar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; I was telling dukkerin only yesterday, 
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, to break the law in everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, brother, who knows? as I said before, gold 
and fine clothes are great temptations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I am sorry for it, I should never have 
thought you so depraved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that I am seated by one who is willing 
to&mdash;to . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To play the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the lubbeny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what, brother?&rdquo; said Ursula, starting from 
her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the lubbeny; don&rsquo;t you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, looking 
somewhat pale, and speaking very low, &ldquo;if I had only 
something in my hand, I would do you a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Ursula?&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;how have I offended you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you offended me?&nbsp; Why, didn&rsquo;t you 
insinivate just now that I was ready to play the&mdash;the . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not say it; but I 
only wish I had something in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have offended, Ursula, I am very sorry for it; any
offence I may have given you was from want of understanding 
you.&nbsp; Come, pray be seated, I have much to question you 
about&mdash;to talk to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seated, not I!&nbsp; It was only just now that you gave
me to understand that you was ashamed to be seated by me, a 
thief, a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you not almost give me to understand that you
were both, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care being called a thief and a 
liar,&rdquo; said Ursula; &ldquo;a person may be a liar and a 
thief, and yet a very honest woman, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother, if you ever sinivate again 
that I could be the third thing, so help me duvel!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll do you a mischief.&nbsp; By my God I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I assure you that I shall sinivate, as 
you call it, nothing of the kind about you.&nbsp; I have no 
doubt, from what you have said, that you are a very paragon of 
virtue&mdash;a perfect Lucretia; but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Ursula, brother, and not Lucretia: Lucretia 
is not of our family, but one of the Bucklands; she travels about
Oxfordshire; yet I am as good as she any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>&ldquo;Lucretia! how odd!&nbsp; Where could she have got
that name?&nbsp; Well, I make no doubt, Ursula, that you are 
quite as good as she, and she as her namesake of ancient Rome; 
but there is a mystery in this same virtue, Ursula, which I 
cannot fathom; how a thief and a liar should be able, or indeed 
willing, to preserve her virtue is what I don&rsquo;t 
understand.&nbsp; You confess that you are very fond of 
gold.&nbsp; Now, how is it that you don&rsquo;t barter your 
virtue for gold sometimes?&nbsp; I am a philosopher, Ursula, and 
like to know everything.&nbsp; You must be every now and then 
exposed to great temptation, Ursula; for you are of a beauty 
calculated to captivate all hearts.&nbsp; Come, sit down and tell
me how you are enabled to resist such a temptation as gold and 
fine clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;as you say 
you mean no harm, I will sit down beside you, and enter into 
discourse with you; but I will uphold that you are the coolest 
hand that I ever came nigh, and say the coolest 
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Ursula sat down by my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, we will, if you please, discourse on the 
subject of your temptations.&nbsp; I suppose that you travel very
much about, and show yourself in all kinds of places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all kinds, brother; I travels, as you say, very much
about, attends fairs and races, and enters booths and 
public-houses, where I tells fortunes, and sometimes dances and 
sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do not people often address you in a very free 
manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently, brother; and I give them tolerably free 
answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do people ever offer to make you presents?&nbsp; I mean
presents of value, such as . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silk handkerchiefs, shawls, and trinkets; very 
frequently, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take what people offers me, brother, and stows it 
away as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but don&rsquo;t people expect something for their
presents?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean dukkerin, dancing, and the 
like; but such a moderate and innocent thing as a choomer, 
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent thing, do you call it, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world calls it so, Ursula.&nbsp; Well, do the 
people who give you the fine things never expect a choomer in 
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very frequently, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>&ldquo;And do you ever grant it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you avoid it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gets away as soon as possible, brother.&nbsp; If they
follows me, I tries to baffle them, by means of jests and 
laughter; and if they persist, I uses bad and terrible language, 
of which I have plenty in store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if your terrible language has no effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I screams for the constable, and if he comes not, 
I uses my teeth and nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they always sufficient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only had to use them twice, brother; but then I 
found them sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the person who followed you was highly 
agreeable, Ursula?&nbsp; A handsome young officer of local 
militia, for example, all dressed in Lincoln green, would you 
still refuse him the choomer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We makes no difference, brother; the daughters of the 
gypsy-father makes no difference; and, what&rsquo;s more, sees 
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, the world will hardly give you credit for
such indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cares we for the world, brother! we are not of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your fathers, brothers, and uncles give you credit 
I suppose, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, our fathers, brothers, and cokos gives
us all manner of credit; for example, I am telling lies and 
dukkerin in a public-house where my batu or coko&mdash;perhaps 
both&mdash;are playing on the fiddle; well, my batu and my coko 
beholds me amongst the public-house crew, talking nonsense and 
hearing nonsense; but they are under no apprehension; and 
presently they sees the good-looking officer of militia, in his 
greens and Lincolns, get up and give me a wink, and I go out with
him abroad, into the dark night perhaps; well, my batu and my 
coko goes on fiddling, just as if I were six miles off asleep in 
the tent, and not out in the dark street with the local officer, 
with his Lincolns and his greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know they can trust you, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother; and, what&rsquo;s more, I knows I can 
trust myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would merely go out to make a fool of him, 
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>&ldquo;Merely go out to make a fool of him, brother, I 
assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such proceedings really have an odd look, 
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst gorgios, very so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be rather unpleasant to lose one&rsquo;s 
character even amongst gorgios, Ursula; and suppose the officer, 
out of revenge for being tricked and duped by you, were to say of
you the thing that is not, were to meet you on the race-course 
the next day, and boast of receiving favours which he never had, 
amidst a knot of jeering militia-men, how would you proceed, 
Ursula? would you not be abashed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, brother; I should bring my action of law 
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; I should give a whistle, whereupon all 
one&rsquo;s cokos and batus, and all my near and distant 
relations, would leave their fiddling, dukkerin, and 
horse-dealing, and come flocking about me.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ursula?&rsquo; says my 
coko.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; I replies, &lsquo;save 
and except that gorgio, in his greens and his Lincolns, says that
I have played the . . . with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oho, he 
does, Ursula,&rsquo; says my coko; &lsquo;try your action of law 
against him, my lamb,&rsquo; and he puts something privily into 
my hands; whereupon I goes close up to the grinning gorgio, and 
staring him in the face, with my head pushed forward, I cries 
out: &lsquo;You say I did what was wrong with you last night when
I was out with you abroad?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says 
the local officer, &lsquo;I says you did,&rsquo; looking down all
the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a liar,&rsquo; says I, and 
forthwith I breaks his head with the stick which I holds behind 
me, and which my coko has conveyed privily into my 
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, this is my action at club-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would your breaking the fellow&rsquo;s head quite 
clear you of all suspicion in the eyes of your batus, cokos, and 
what not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would never suspect me at all, brother, because 
they would know that I would never condescend to be over intimate
with a gorgio; the breaking the head would be merely intended to 
justify Ursula in the eyes of the gorgios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would it clear you in their eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not, brother?&nbsp; When they saw the blood 
running down from the fellow&rsquo;s cracked poll on his greens 
and Lincolns, they would be quite satisfied; why, the fellow 
would not be able <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>to show his face at fair or 
merry-making for a year and three quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever try it, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I ever did, brother, but it would 
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you ever learn such a method of 
proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis advised by gypsy liri, brother.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s part of our way of settling difficulties amongst 
ourselves; for example, if a young Roman were to say the thing 
which is not respecting Ursula and himself, Ursula would call a 
great meeting of the people, who would all sit down in a ring, 
the young fellow amongst them; a coko would then put a stick in 
Ursula&rsquo;s hand, who would then get up and go to the young 
fellow, and say, &lsquo;Did I play the . . . with you?&rsquo; and
were he to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she would crack his head before
the eyes of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Ursula, I was bred an 
apprentice to gorgio law, and of course ought to stand up for it,
whenever I conscientiously can, but I must say the gypsy manner 
of bringing an action for defamation is much less tedious, and 
far more satisfactory, than the gorgiko one.&nbsp; I wish you now
to clear up a certain point which is rather mysterious to 
me.&nbsp; You say that for a Romany chi to do what is unseemly 
with a gorgio is quite out of the question, yet only the other 
day I heard you singing a song in which a Romany chi confesses 
herself to be cambri by a grand gorgious gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad let down,&rdquo; said Ursula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sad or not, there&rsquo;s 
the song that speaks of the thing, which you give me to 
understand is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the thing ever was,&rdquo; said Ursula, 
&ldquo;it was a long time ago, and perhaps, after all, not 
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you sing the song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, brother: we sings the song now and
then to be a warning to ourselves to have as little to do as 
possible in the way of acquaintance with the gorgios; and a 
warning it is.&nbsp; You see how the young woman in the song was 
driven out of her tent by her mother, with all kind of disgrace 
and bad language; but you don&rsquo;t know that she was 
afterwards buried alive by her cokos and pals, in an uninhabited 
place.&nbsp; The song doesn&rsquo;t say it, but the story says 
it; for there is a story about it, though, as I said before, it 
was a long time ago, and perhaps, after all, wasn&rsquo;t 
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if such a thing were to happen at present, would 
the cokos and pals bury the girl alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what they would do,&rdquo; said
Ursula.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose they are not so strict as they 
were long ago; at any rate she would be driven from the tan, and 
avoided by all her family and relations as a gorgio&rsquo;s 
acquaintance, so that, perhaps, at last, she would be glad if 
they would bury her alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can conceive that there would be an objection 
on the part of the cokos and batus that a Romany chi should form 
an improper acquaintance with a gorgio, but I should think that 
the batus and cokos could hardly object to the chi&rsquo;s 
entering into the honourable estate of wedlock with a 
gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ursula was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is an honourable estate, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a Romany chi should object to 
enter into the honourable estate of wedlock with a 
gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, brother; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, moreover, I am aware, 
notwithstanding your evasion, Ursula, that marriages and 
connections now and then occur between gorgios and Romany chies; 
the result of which is the mixed breed, called half-and-half, 
which is at present travelling about England, and to which the 
Flaming Tinman belongs, otherwise called Anselo Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the half-and-halfs,&rdquo; said Ursula, 
&ldquo;they are a bad set; and there is not a worse blackguard in
England than Anselo Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what you say may be very true, Ursula, but you 
admit that there are half-and-halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity or not, you admit the fact; but how do you account
for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I account for it? why, I will tell you, by the 
break up of a Roman family, brother,&mdash;the father of a small 
family dies, and perhaps the mother; and the poor children are 
left behind; sometimes they are gathered up by their relations, 
and sometimes, if they have none, by charitable Romans, who bring
them up in the observance of gypsy law; but sometimes they are 
not so lucky, and falls into the company of gorgios, trampers, 
and basket-makers, who live in caravans, with whom they take up, 
and so . . . I hate to talk of the matter, brother; but so comes 
this race of the half-and-halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi, <!-- 
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>unless compelled by hard necessity, would have anything 
to do with a gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not over fond of gorgios, brother, and we hates 
basket-makers and folks that live in caravans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose a gorgio, who is 
not a basket-maker, a fine handsome gorgious gentleman, who lives
in a fine house . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not fond of houses, brother.&nbsp; I never slept
in a house in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would not plenty of money induce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate houses, brother, and those who live in 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose such a person were willing to resign his 
fine house, and, for love of you, to adopt gypsy law, speak 
Romany, and live in a tan, would you have nothing to say to 
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing plenty of money with him, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bringing plenty of money with him, 
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose you produce your man; where is 
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely supposing such a person, 
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know of such a person, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Ursula; why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, brother, I was almost beginning to think that 
you meant yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, Ursula!&nbsp; I have no fine house to resign; 
nor have I money.&nbsp; Moreover, Ursula, though I have a great 
regard for you, and though I consider you very handsome, quite as
handsome, indeed, as Meridiana in . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meridiana! where did you meet with her?&rdquo; said 
Ursula, with a toss of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in old Pulci&rsquo;s . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At old Fulcher&rsquo;s! that&rsquo;s not true, 
brother.&nbsp; Meridiana is a Borzlam, and travels with her own 
people, and not with old Fulcher, who is a gorgio and a 
basket-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not speaking of old Fulcher, but Pulci, a great 
Italian writer, who lived many hundred years ago, and who, in his
poem called the &lsquo;Morgante Maggiore,&rsquo; speaks of 
Meridiana, the daughter of . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Carus Borzlam,&rdquo; said Ursula; &ldquo;but if 
the fellow you mention lived so many hundred years ago, how, in 
the name of wonder, could he know anything of 
Meridiana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wonder, Ursula, is, how your people could ever have
got hold of that name, and similar ones.&nbsp; The Meridiana of 
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>Pulci was not the daughter of old Carus Borzlam, but of 
Caradoro, a great pagan king of the East, who, being besieged in 
his capital by Manfredonio, another mighty pagan king, who wished
to obtain possession of his daughter, who had refused him, was 
relieved in his distress by certain paladins of Charlemagne, with
one of whom, Oliver, his daughter Meridiana fell in 
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;that it must have 
been altogether a different person, for I am sure that Meridiana 
Borzlam would never have fallen in love with Oliver.&nbsp; 
Oliver! why, that is the name of the curo-mengro who lost the 
fight near the chong gav, the day of the great tempest, when I 
got wet through.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Meridiana Borzlam would 
never have so far forgot her blood as to take up with Tom 
Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not talking of that Oliver, Ursula, but of 
Oliver, peer of France, and paladin of Charlemagne, with whom 
Meridiana, daughter of Caradoro, fell in love, and for whose sake
she renounced her religion and became a Christian, and finally 
ingravidata, or cambri, by him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;E nacquene un figliuol, dice la storia,<br 
/>
Che dette a Carlo-man poi gran vittoria:&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what it means,&rdquo; said 
Ursula; &ldquo;no good, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Well, if the 
Meridiana of Charles&rsquo;s wain&rsquo;s pal was no handsomer 
than Meridiana Borzlam, she was no great catch, brother; for 
though I am by no means given to vanity, I think myself better to
look at than she, though I will say she is no lubbeny, and would 
scorn . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no doubt she would, Ursula, and I make no doubt 
that you are much handsomer than she, or even the Meridiana of 
Oliver.&nbsp; What I was about to say, before you interrupted me,
is this, that though I have a great regard for you, and highly 
admire you, it is only in a brotherly way, and . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had nothing better to say to me,&rdquo; said 
Ursula, &ldquo;when you wanted to talk to me beneath a hedge, 
than that you liked me in a brotherly way! well, I declare . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed, brother! not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were just now saying that you disliked gorgios, so,
of course, could only wish that I, who am a gorgio, should like 
you in a brotherly way; I wished to have a conversation with <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>you beneath a hedge, but only with the view of procuring
from you some information respecting the song which you sung the 
other day, and the conduct of Roman females, which has always 
struck me as being highly unaccountable, so, if you thought 
anything else . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I expect from a picker-up of old 
words, brother?&nbsp; Bah! I dislike a picker-up of old words 
worse than a picker-up of old rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Ursula, I feel a great interest 
in you; you are very handsome, and very clever; indeed, with your
beauty and cleverness, I only wonder that you have not long since
been married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, do you, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; However, keep up your spirits, Ursula, you 
are not much past the prime of youth, so . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much past the prime of youth!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be 
uncivil, brother; I was only twenty-two last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, Ursula, but twenty-two is 
twenty-two, or I should rather say, that twenty-two in a woman is
more than twenty-six in a man.&nbsp; You are still very 
beautiful, but I advise you to accept the first offer 
that&rsquo;s made to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, brother, but your advice comes rather late; 
I accepted the first offer that was made me five years 
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You married five years ago, Ursula! is it 
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, brother, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came I to know nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it that you don&rsquo;t know many thousand 
things about the Romans, brother?&nbsp; Do you think they tell 
you all their affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married, Ursula, married! well, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed!&nbsp; Oh, no! not at all; but Jasper, 
only a few weeks ago, told me that you were not married; and, 
indeed, almost gave me to understand that you would be very glad 
to get a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, 
brother, for your instruction, that there is not in the whole 
world a greater liar than Jasper Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear it, Ursula; but with respect to him 
you married&mdash;who might he be?&nbsp; A gorgio, or a Romany 
chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgio, or Romany chal?&nbsp; Do you think I would ever
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>condescend to a gorgio?&nbsp; It was a Camomescro, 
brother, a Lovell, a distant relation of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is he; and what became of him?&nbsp; Have you
any family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am going to tell you all my 
history, brother; and, to tell you the truth, I am tired of 
sitting under hedges with you, talking nonsense.&nbsp; I shall go
to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit a little longer, sister Ursula.&nbsp; I most 
heartily congratulate you on your marriage.&nbsp; But where is 
this same Lovell?&nbsp; I have never seen him: I should wish to 
congratulate him too.&nbsp; You are quite as handsome as the 
Meridiana of Pulci, Ursula, ay, or the Despina of 
Riciardetto.&nbsp; Riciardetto, Ursula, is a poem written by one 
Fortiguerra, about ninety years ago, in imitation of the Morgante
of Pulci.&nbsp; It treats of the wars of Charlemagne and his 
Paladins with various barbarous nations, who came to besiege 
Paris.&nbsp; Despina was the daughter and heiress of Scricca, 
King of Cafria; she was the beloved of Riciardetto, and was 
beautiful as an angel; but I make no doubt you are quite as 
handsome as she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Ursula&mdash;but the reply of 
Ursula I reserve for another chapter, the present having attained
to rather an uncommon length, for which, however, the importance 
of the matter discussed is a sufficient apology.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>URSULA&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;THE PATTERAN&mdash;THE DEEP 
WATER&mdash;SECOND HUSBAND.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, plucking a dandelion which
grew at her feet, &ldquo;I have always said that a more civil and
pleasant-spoken person than yourself can&rsquo;t be found.&nbsp; 
I have a great regard for you and your learning, and am willing 
to do you any pleasure in the way of words or conversation.&nbsp;
Mine is not a very happy story, but as you wish to hear it, it is
quite at your service.&nbsp; Launcelot Lovell made me an offer, 
as you call it, and we were married in Roman fashion; that is, we
gave each other our right hands, and promised to be true to each 
other.&nbsp; We lived together two years, travelling sometimes 
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>by ourselves, sometimes with our relations; I bore him 
two children, both of which were still-born, partly, I believe, 
from the fatigue I underwent in running about the country telling
dukkerin when I was not exactly in a state to do so, and partly 
from the kicks and blows which my husband Launcelot was in the 
habit of giving me every night, provided I came home with less 
than five shillings, which it is sometimes impossible to make in 
the country, provided no fair or merry-making is going on.&nbsp; 
At the end of two years my husband, Launcelot, whistled a horse 
from a farmer&rsquo;s field, and sold it for forty pounds; and 
for that horse he was taken, put in prison, tried, and condemned 
to be sent to the other country for life.&nbsp; Two days before 
he was to be sent away, I got leave to see him in the prison, and
in the presence of the turnkey I gave him a thin cake of 
gingerbread, in which there was a dainty saw which could cut 
through iron.&nbsp; I then took on wonderfully, turned my eyes 
inside out, fell down in a seeming fit, and was carried out of 
the prison.&nbsp; That same night my husband sawed his irons off,
cut through the bars of his window, and dropping down a height of
fifty feet, lighted on his legs, and came and joined me on a 
heath where I was camped alone.&nbsp; We were just getting things
ready to be off, when we heard people coming, and sure enough 
they were runners after my husband, Launcelot Lovell; for his 
escape had been discovered within a quarter of an hour after he 
had got away.&nbsp; My husband, without bidding me farewell, set 
off at full speed, and they after him, but they could not take 
him, and so they came back and took me, and shook me, and 
threatened me, and had me before the poknees, who shook his head 
at me, and threatened me in order to make me discover where my 
husband was, but I said I did not know, which was true enough; 
not that I would have told him if I had.&nbsp; So at last the 
poknees and the runners, not being able to make anything out of 
me, were obliged to let me go, and I went in search of my 
husband.&nbsp; I wandered about with my cart for several days in 
the direction in which I saw him run off, with my eyes bent on 
the ground, but could see no marks of him; at last, coming to 
four cross roads, I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw your husband&rsquo;s patteran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother.&nbsp; Do you know what patteran 
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Ursula; the gypsy trail, the handful of 
grass which the gypsies strew in the roads as they travel, to 
give <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>information to any of their companions who may be 
behind, as to the route they have taken.&nbsp; The gypsy patteran
has always had a strange interest for me, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; but what does patteran 
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the gypsy trail, formed as I told you 
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing more about patteran, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Ursula; do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name for the leaf of a tree, 
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 
odd enough that I have asked that question of a dozen Romany 
chals and chies, and they always told me that they did not 
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more they did, brother; there&rsquo;s only one 
person in England that knows, and that&rsquo;s myself&mdash;the 
name for a leaf is patteran.&nbsp; Now there are two that knows 
it&mdash;the other is yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Ursula, how very strange!&nbsp; I am much 
obliged to you.&nbsp; I think I never saw you look so pretty as 
you do now; but who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, Mrs. Herne, told it me one day, brother, 
when she was in a good humour, which she very seldom was, as no 
one has a better right to know than yourself, as she hated you 
mortally: it was one day when you had been asking our company 
what was the word for a leaf, and nobody could tell you, that she
took me aside and told me, for she was in a good humour, and 
triumphed in seeing you balked.&nbsp; She told me the word for 
leaf was patteran, which our people use now for trail, having 
forgotten the true meaning.&nbsp; She said that the trail was 
called patteran, because the gypsies of old were in the habit of 
making the marks with the leaves and branches of trees, placed in
a certain manner.&nbsp; She said that nobody knew it but herself,
who was one of the old sort, and begged me never to tell the word
to any one but him I should marry; and to be particularly 
cautious never to let you know it, whom she hated.&nbsp; Well, 
brother, perhaps I have done wrong to tell you; but, as I said 
before, I likes you, and am always ready to do your pleasure in 
words and conversation; my mother, moreover, is dead and gone, 
and, poor thing, will never know anything about the matter.&nbsp;
So, when I married, I told my husband about the patteran, and we 
were in the habit of making our private trail with leaves and 
branches of trees, which none of the other gypsy people did; so, 
when I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran, I knew it at once, and I 
followed it upwards of two <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>hundred miles
towards the north; and then I came to a deep, awful-looking 
water, with an overhanging bank, and on the bank I found the 
patteran, which directed me to proceed along the bank towards the
east, and I followed my husband&rsquo;s patteran towards the 
east; and before I had gone half a mile, I came to a place where 
I saw the bank had given way, and fallen into the deep 
water.&nbsp; Without paying much heed, I passed on, and presently
came to a public-house, not far from the water, and I entered the
public-house to get a little beer, and perhaps to tell a 
dukkerin, for I saw a great many people about the door; and, when
I entered, I found there was what they calls an inquest being 
held upon a body in that house, and the jury had just risen to go
and look at the body; and being a woman, and having a curiosity, 
I thought I would go with them, and so I did; and no sooner did I
see the body than I knew it to be my husband&rsquo;s; it was much
swelled and altered, but I knew it partly by the clothes, and 
partly by a mark on the forehead, and I cried out, &lsquo;It is 
my husband&rsquo;s body,&rsquo; and I fell down in a fit, and the
fit that time, brother, was not a seeming one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how terrible! but tell 
me, Ursula, how did your husband come by his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank, overhanging the deep water, gave way under 
him, brother, and he was drowned; for, like most of our people, 
he could not swim, or only a little.&nbsp; The body, after it had
been in the water a long time, came up of itself, and was found 
floating.&nbsp; Well, brother, when the people of the 
neighbourhood found that I was the wife of the drowned man, they 
were very kind to me, and made a subscription for me, with which,
after having seen my husband buried, I returned the way I had 
come, till I met Jasper and his people, and with them I have 
travelled ever since: I was very melancholy for a long time, I 
assure you, brother; for the death of my husband preyed very much
upon my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His death was certainly a very shocking one, Ursula; 
but, really, if he had died a natural one, you could scarcely 
have regretted it, for he appears to have treated you 
barbarously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he kicked 
and beat me, and drove me out to tell dukkerin when I could 
scarcely stand, he was not a bad husband.&nbsp; A man, by gypsy 
law, brother, is allowed to kick and beat his wife, and to bury 
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>her alive, if he thinks proper.&nbsp; I am a gypsy, and 
have nothing to say against the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has Mikailia Chikno to say about 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a cripple, brother, the only cripple amongst the
Roman people: so she is allowed to do and say as she 
pleases.&nbsp; Moreover, her husband does not think fit to kick 
or beat her, though it is my opinion she would like him all the 
better if he were occasionally to do so, and threaten to bury her
alive; at any rate, she would treat him better, and respect him 
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of 
Jasper Petulengro, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the matters of my sister and Jasper Petulengro 
alone, brother; you must travel in their company some time before
you can understand them; they are a strange two, up to all kind 
of chaffing: but two more regular Romans don&rsquo;t breathe, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you, for your instruction, that there isn&rsquo;t
a better mare-breaker in England than Jasper Petulengro, if you 
can manage Miss Isopel Berners as well as . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isopel Berners,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how came you to 
think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I but think of her, brother, living as she 
does with you in Mumper&rsquo;s dingle, and travelling about with
you; you will have, brother, more difficulty to manage her, than 
Jasper has to manage my sister Pakomovna.&nbsp; I should have 
mentioned her before, only I wanted to know what you had to say 
to me; and when we got into discourse, I forgot her.&nbsp; I say,
brother, let me tell you your dukkerin, with respect to her, you 
will never, . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me tell you your dukkerin, brother, you will 
never manage . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula, in connection with 
Isopel Berners.&nbsp; Moreover, it is Sunday, we will change the 
subject; it is surprising to me that, after all you have 
undergone, you should still look so beautiful.&nbsp; I suppose 
you do not think of marrying again, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother, one husband at a time is quite enough for 
any reasonable mort; especially such a good husband as I have 
got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a good husband! why, I thought you told me your 
husband was drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, my first husband was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you a second?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>&ldquo;To be sure, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he, in the name of wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he? why Sylvester, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you, Ursula, that I feel disposed to be 
angry with you; such a handsome young woman as yourself to take 
up with such a nasty pepper-faced good-for-nothing . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear my husband abused, brother; so you 
had better say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is he not the Lazarus of the gypsies? has he a 
penny of his own, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the more his want, brother, of a clever chi like 
me to take care of him and his childer.&nbsp; I tell you what, 
brother, I will chore, if necessary, and tell dukkerin for 
Sylvester, if even so heavy as scarcely to be able to 
stand.&nbsp; You call him lazy; you would not think him lazy if 
you were in a ring with him; he is a proper man with his hands: 
Jasper is going to back him for twenty pounds against Slammocks 
of the Chong gav, the brother of Roarer and Bell-metal; he says 
he has no doubt that he will win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you like him, I, of course, can have no 
objection.&nbsp; Have you been long married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a fortnight, brother; that dinner, the other day,
when I sang the song, was given in celebration of the 
wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you married in a church, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were not, brother; none but gorgios, cripples, and 
lubbenys are ever married in a church: we took each other&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; Brother, I have been with you near three hours 
beneath this hedge.&nbsp; I will go to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know that you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied! of course.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, you 
gorgios!&nbsp; Brother, I go to my husband and my 
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, thereupon, Ursula rose and departed.</p>
<p>After waiting a little time I also arose; it was now dark, and
I thought I could do no better than betake myself to the dingle; 
at the entrance of it I found Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, 
brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what kind of conversation have 
you and Ursula had beneath the hedge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wished to hear what we were talking about, you 
should have come and sat down beside us; you knew where we 
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>&ldquo;Well, brother, I did much the same, for I went 
and sat down behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And heard all our conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word, brother; and a rum conversation it 
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an old saying, Jasper, that listeners never 
hear any good of themselves; perhaps you heard the epithet that 
Ursula bestowed upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, by epitaph, you mean that she called me a liar, I 
did, brother, and she was not much wrong, for I certainly do not 
always stick exactly to truth; you, however, have not much to 
complain of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deceived me about Ursula, giving me to understand 
she was not married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not married when I told you so, brother; that 
is, not to Sylvester; nor was I aware that she was going to marry
him.&nbsp; I once thought you had a kind of regard for her, and I
am sure she had as much for you as a Romany chi can have for a 
gorgio.&nbsp; I half expected to have heard you make love to her 
behind the hedge, but I begin to think you care for nothing in 
this world but old words and strange stories.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, 
to take a young woman under a hedge, and talk to her as you did 
to Ursula; and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted,
with your gammon about old Fulcher and Meridiana.&nbsp; You are a
cunning one, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken, Jasper.&nbsp; I am not 
cunning.&nbsp; If people think I am, it is because, being made up
of art themselves, simplicity of character is a puzzle to 
them.&nbsp; Your women are certainly extraordinary creatures, 
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say they were rum animals?&nbsp; 
Brother, we Romans shall always stick together as long as they 
stick fast to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they always will, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, brother; nothing lasts for ever.&nbsp;
Romany chies are Romany chies still, though not exactly what they
were sixty years ago.&nbsp; My wife, though a rum one, is not 
Mrs. Herne, brother.&nbsp; I think she is rather fond of 
Frenchmen and French discourse.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, 
if ever gypsyism breaks up, it will be owing to our chies having 
been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentility.&rdquo;</p>

77</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>THE DINGLE AT NIGHT&mdash;THE TWO SIDES OF THE 
QUESTION&mdash;ROMAN FEMALES&mdash;FILLING THE KETTLE&mdash;THE 
DREAM&mdash;THE TALL FIGURE.</p>
<p>I descended to the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp; It was nearly 
involved in obscurity.&nbsp; To dissipate the feeling of 
melancholy which came over my mind, I resolved to kindle a fire; 
and having heaped dry sticks upon my hearth, and added a billet 
or two, I struck a light, and soon produced a blaze.&nbsp; 
Sitting down, I fixed my eyes upon the blaze, and soon fell into 
a deep meditation.&nbsp; I thought of the events of the day, the 
scene at church, and what I had heard at church, the danger of 
losing one&rsquo;s soul, the doubts of Jasper Petulengro as to 
whether one had a soul.&nbsp; I thought over the various 
arguments which I had either heard, or which had come 
spontaneously to my mind, for or against the probability of a 
state of future existence.&nbsp; They appeared to me to be 
tolerably evenly balanced.&nbsp; I then thought that it was at 
all events taking the safest part to conclude that there was a 
soul.&nbsp; It would be a terrible thing, after having passed 
one&rsquo;s life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul, to 
wake up after death a soul, and to find one&rsquo;s self a lost 
soul.&nbsp; Yes, methought I would come to the conclusion that 
one has a soul.&nbsp; Choosing the safe side, however, appeared 
to me playing rather a dastardly part.&nbsp; I had never been an 
admirer of people who chose the safe side in everything; indeed I
had always entertained a thorough contempt for them.&nbsp; Surely
it would be showing more manhood to adopt the dangerous side, 
that of disbelief; I almost resolved to do so&mdash;but yet in a 
question of so much importance, I ought not to be guided by 
vanity.&nbsp; The question was not which was the safe, but the 
true side? yet how was I to know which was the true side?&nbsp; 
Then I thought of the Bible&mdash;which I had been reading in the
morning&mdash;that spoke of the soul and a future state; but was 
the Bible true?&nbsp; I had heard learned and moral men say that 
it was true, but I had also heard learned and moral men say that 
it was not: how was I to decide?&nbsp; Still that balance of 
probabilities!&nbsp; If I could but see the way of truth, I would
follow it, if necessary, upon hands and knees; on that I was 
determined; but I could not see it.&nbsp; Feeling my brain begin 
to turn round, I resolved to think of <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>something 
else; and forthwith began to think of what had passed between 
Ursula and myself in our discourse beneath the hedge.</p>
<p>I mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the
females of her race.&nbsp; How singular that virtue must be which
was kept pure and immaculate by the possessor, whilst indulging 
in habits of falsehood and dishonesty.&nbsp; I had always thought
the gypsy females extraordinary beings.&nbsp; I had often 
wondered at them, their dress, their manner of speaking, and, not
least, at their names; but, until the present day, I had been 
unacquainted with the most extraordinary point connected with 
them.&nbsp; How came they possessed of this extraordinary virtue?
was it because they were thievish?&nbsp; I remembered that an 
ancient thief-taker, who had retired from his useful calling, and
who frequently visited the office of my master at law, the 
respectable S . . ., who had the management of his 
property&mdash;I remembered to have heard this worthy, with whom 
I occasionally held discourse, philosophic and profound, when he 
and I chanced to be alone together in the office, say that all 
first-rate thieves were sober, and of well-regulated morals, 
their bodily passions being kept in abeyance by their love of 
gain; but this axiom could scarcely hold good with respect to 
these women&mdash;however thievish they might be, they did care 
for something besides gain: they cared for their husbands.&nbsp; 
If they did thieve, they merely thieved for their husbands; and 
though, perhaps, some of them were vain, they merely prized their
beauty because it gave them favour in the eyes of their 
husbands.&nbsp; Whatever the husbands were&mdash;and Jasper had 
almost insinuated that the males occasionally allowed themselves 
some latitude&mdash;they appeared to be as faithful to their 
husbands as the ancient Roman matrons were to theirs.&nbsp; Roman
matrons! and, after all, might not these be in reality Roman 
matrons?&nbsp; They called themselves Romans; might not they be 
the descendants of the old Roman matrons?&nbsp; Might not they be
of the same blood as Lucretia?&nbsp; And were not many of their 
strange names&mdash;Lucretia amongst the rest&mdash;handed down 
to them from old Rome?&nbsp; It is true their language was not 
that of old Rome; it was not, however, altogether different from 
it.&nbsp; After all, the ancient Romans might be a tribe of these
people, who settled down and founded a village with the tilts of 
carts, which by degrees, and the influx of other people, became 
the grand city of the world.&nbsp; I liked the idea of the grand 
city of the world owing its origin <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to a people 
who had been in the habit of carrying their houses in their 
carts.&nbsp; Why, after all, should not the Romans of history be 
a branch of these Romans?&nbsp; There were several points of 
similarity between them; if Roman matrons were chaste, both men 
and women were thieves.&nbsp; Old Rome was the thief of the 
world; yet still there were difficulties to be removed before I 
could persuade myself that the old Romans and my Romans were 
identical; and in trying to remove these difficulties, I felt my 
brain once more beginning to turn, and in haste took up another 
subject of meditation, and that was the patteran, and what Ursula
had told me about it.</p>
<p>I had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by 
which in their wanderings the Romanese gave to those of their 
people who came behind intimation as to the direction which they 
took; but it now inspired me with greater interest than 
ever,&mdash;now that I had learned that the proper meaning of it 
was the leaves of trees.&nbsp; I had, as I had said in my 
dialogue with Ursula, been very eager to learn the word for leaf 
in the Romanian language, but had never learned it till this day;
so patteran signified leaf, the leaf of a tree; and no one at 
present knew that but myself and Ursula, who had learned it from 
Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the old stock; and then I 
thought what strange people the gypsies must have been in the old
time.&nbsp; They were sufficiently strange at present, but they 
must have been far stranger of old; they must have been a more 
peculiar people&mdash;their language must have been more 
perfect&mdash;and they must have had a greater stock of strange 
secrets.&nbsp; I almost wished that I had lived some two or three
hundred years ago, that I might have observed these people when 
they were yet stranger than at present.&nbsp; I wondered whether 
I could have introduced myself to their company at that period, 
whether I should have been so fortunate as to meet such a 
strange, half-malicious, half good-humoured being as Jasper, who 
would have instructed me in the language, then more deserving of 
note than at present.&nbsp; What might I not have done with that 
language, had I known it in its purity?&nbsp; Why, I might have 
written books in it; yet those who spoke it would hardly have 
admitted me to their society at that period, when they kept more 
to themselves.&nbsp; Yet I thought that I might possibly have 
gained their confidence, and have wandered about with them, and 
learned their language, and all their strange ways, and 
then&mdash;and then&mdash;<!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and a sigh 
rose from the depth of my breast; for I began to think, 
&ldquo;Supposing I had accomplished all this, what would have 
been the profit of it? and in what would all this wild gypsy 
dream have terminated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rose another sigh, yet more profound, for I began to 
think, &ldquo;What was likely to be the profit of my present way 
of life; the living in dingles, making pony and donkey shoes, 
conversing with gypsy-women under hedges, and extracting from 
them their odd secrets?&rdquo;&nbsp; What was likely to be the 
profit of such a kind of life, even should it continue for a 
length of time?&mdash;a supposition not very probable, for I was 
earning nothing to support me, and the funds with which I had 
entered upon this life were gradually disappearing.&nbsp; I was 
living, it is true, not unpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of
heaven; but, upon the whole, was I not sadly misspending my 
time?&nbsp; Surely I was; and, as I looked back, it appeared to 
me that I had always been doing so.&nbsp; What had been the 
profit of the tongues which I had learned? had they ever assisted
me in the day of hunger?&nbsp; No, no! it appeared to me that I 
had always misspent my time, save in one instance, when by a 
desperate effort I had collected all the powers of my 
imagination, and written the &ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell;&rdquo; 
but even when I wrote the Life of Sell, was I not in a false 
position?&nbsp; Provided I had not misspent my time, would it 
have been necessary to make that effort, which, after all, had 
only enabled me to leave London, and wander about the country for
a time?&nbsp; But could I, taking all circumstances into 
consideration, have done better than I had?&nbsp; With my 
peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have pursued with 
advantage the profession to which my respectable parents had 
endeavoured to bring me up?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I could 
not, and that the hand of necessity had guided me from my 
earliest years, until the present night in which I found myself 
seated in the dingle, staring on the brands of the fire.&nbsp; 
But ceasing to think of the past which, as irrecoverably gone, it
was useless to regret, even were there cause to regret it, what 
should I do in future?&nbsp; Should I write another book like the
Life of Joseph Sell; take it to London, and offer it to a 
publisher?&nbsp; But when I reflected on the grisly sufferings 
which I had undergone whilst engaged in writing the Life of Sell,
I shrank from the idea of a similar attempt; moreover, I doubted 
whether I possessed the power to write a similar work&mdash;<!-- 
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>whether the materials for the life of another Sell 
lurked within the recesses of my brain?&nbsp; Had I not better 
become in reality what I had hitherto been merely playing 
at&mdash;a tinker or a gypsy?&nbsp; But I soon saw that I was not
fitted to become either in reality.&nbsp; It was much more 
agreeable to play the gypsy or the tinker, than to become either 
in reality.&nbsp; I had seen enough of gypsying and tinkering to 
be convinced of that.&nbsp; All of a sudden the idea of tilling 
the soil came into my head; tilling the soil was a healthful and 
noble pursuit! but my idea of tilling the soil had no connection 
with Britain; for I could only expect to till the soil in Britain
as a serf.&nbsp; I thought of tilling it in America, in which it 
was said there was plenty of wild, unclaimed land, of which any 
one, who chose to clear it of its trees, might take 
possession.&nbsp; I figured myself in America, in an immense 
forest, clearing the land destined, by my exertions, to become a 
fruitful and smiling plain.&nbsp; Methought I heard the crash of 
the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe; and then I bethought 
me that a man was intended to marry&mdash;I ought to marry; and 
if I married, where was I likely to be more happy as a husband 
and a father than in America, engaged in tilling the 
ground?&nbsp; I fancied myself in America, engaged in tilling the
ground, assisted by an enormous progeny.&nbsp; Well, why not 
marry, and go and till the ground in America?&nbsp; I was young, 
and youth was the time to marry in, and to labour in.&nbsp; I had
the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is true, were rather 
dull from early study, and from writing the Life of Joseph Sell; 
but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were not 
bleared.&nbsp; I felt my arms, and thighs, and teeth&mdash;they 
were strong and sound enough; so now was the time to labour, to 
marry, eat strong flesh, and beget strong children&mdash;the 
power of doing all this would pass away with youth, which was 
terribly transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that a time would come 
when my eyes would be bleared, and, perhaps, sightless; my arms 
and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my teeth would shake in
my jaws, even supposing they did not drop out.&nbsp; No going a 
wooing then&mdash;no labouring&mdash;no eating strong flesh, and 
begetting lusty children then; and I bethought me how, when all 
this should be, I should bewail the days of my youth as misspent,
provided I had not in them founded for myself a home, and 
begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when I 
could not take care of myself; and thinking of these things, I 
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>became sadder and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the 
fire till my eyes closed in a doze.</p>
<p>I continued dozing over the fire, until rousing myself I 
perceived that the brands were nearly consumed, and I thought of 
retiring for the night.&nbsp; I arose, and was about to enter my 
tent, when a thought struck me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; 
thought I, &ldquo;that Isopel Berners should return in the midst 
of the night, how dark and dreary would the dingle appear without
a fire! truly, I will keep up the fire, and I will do more; I 
have no board to spread for her, but I will fill the kettle, and 
heat it, so that if she comes, I may be able to welcome her with 
a cup of tea, for I know she loves tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon, I
piled more wood upon the fire, and soon succeeded in producing a 
better blaze than before; then, taking the kettle, I set out for 
the spring.&nbsp; On arriving at the mouth of the dingle, which 
fronted the east, I perceived that Charles&rsquo;s wain was 
nearly opposite to it, high above in the heavens, by which I knew
that the night was tolerably well advanced.&nbsp; The gypsy 
encampment lay before me; all was hushed and still within it, and
its inmates appeared to be locked in slumber; as I advanced, 
however, the dogs, which were fastened outside the tents, growled
and barked; but presently recognising me, they were again silent,
some of them wagging their tails.&nbsp; As I drew near a 
particular tent, I heard a female voice say&mdash;&ldquo;Some one
is coming!&rdquo; and, as I was about to pass it, the cloth which
formed the door was suddenly lifted up, and a black head and part
of a huge naked body protruded.&nbsp; It was the head and upper 
part of the giant Tawno, who, according to the fashion of gypsy 
men, lay next the door, wrapped in his blanket; the blanket had, 
however, fallen off, and the starlight shone clear on his 
athletic tawny body, and was reflected from his large staring 
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only I, Tawno,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;going to 
fill the kettle, as it is possible that Miss Berners may arrive 
this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kos-ko,&rdquo; drawled out Tawno,
and replaced the curtain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, do you call 
it?&rdquo; said the sharp voice of his wife; &ldquo;there is no 
good in the matter; if that young chap were not living with the 
rawnee in the illegal and uncertificated line, he would not be 
getting up in the middle of the night to fill her 
kettles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing on, I proceeded to the spring, 
where I filled the kettle, and then returned to the dingle.</p>
<p>Placing the kettle upon the fire, I watched it till it began 
to boil; then removing it from the top of the brands, I placed it
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>close beside the fire, and leaving it simmering, I 
retired to my tent; where, having taken off my shoes, and a few 
of my garments, I lay down on my palliasse, and was not long in 
falling asleep.&nbsp; I believe I slept soundly for some time, 
thinking and dreaming of nothing; suddenly, however, my sleep 
became disturbed, and the subject of the patterans began to 
occupy my brain.&nbsp; I imagined that I saw Ursula tracing her 
husband, Launcelot Lovell, by means of his patterans; I imagined 
that she had considerable difficulty in doing so; that she was 
occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and constables, who 
asked her whither she was travelling, to whom she gave various 
answers.&nbsp; Presently me thought that, as she was passing by a
farm-yard, two fierce and savage dogs flew at her; I was in great
trouble, I remember, and wished to assist her, but could not, for
though I seemed to see her, I was still at a distance: and now it
appeared that she had escaped from the dogs, and was proceeding 
with her cart along a gravelly path which traversed a wild moor; 
I could hear the wheels grating amidst sand and gravel.&nbsp; The
next moment I was awake, and found myself sitting up in my tent; 
there was a glimmer of light through the canvas caused by the 
fire; a feeling of dread came over me, which was perhaps natural,
on starting suddenly from one&rsquo;s sleep in that wild lone 
place; I half imagined that some one was nigh the tent; the idea 
made me rather uncomfortable, and to dissipate it I lifted up the
canvas of the door and peeped out, and, lo! I had an indistinct 
view of a tall figure standing by the tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is 
that?&rdquo; said I, whilst I felt my blood rush to my 
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said the voice of Isopel 
Berners; &ldquo;you little expected me, I dare say; well, sleep 
on, I do not wish to disturb you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I was 
expecting you,&rdquo; said I, recovering myself, &ldquo;as you 
may see by the fire and the kettle.&nbsp; I will be with you in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung 
off, I came out of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who
was standing beside her cart, I said&mdash;&ldquo;Just as I was 
about to retire to rest I thought it possible that you might come
to-night, and got everything in readiness for you.&nbsp; Now, sit
down by the fire whilst I lead the donkey and cart to the place 
where you stay; I will unharness the animal, and presently come 
and join you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I need not trouble you,&rdquo; 
said Isopel; &ldquo;I will go myself and see after my 
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We will go together,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and then return and have some <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel made no objection, and in about
half-an-hour we had arranged everything at her quarters, I then 
hastened and prepared tea.&nbsp; Presently Isopel rejoined me, 
bringing her stool; she had divested herself of her bonnet, and 
her hair fell over her shoulders; she sat down, and I poured out 
the beverage, handing her a cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you made a 
long journey to-night?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very long 
one,&rdquo; replied Belle, &ldquo;I have come nearly twenty miles
since six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe I heard 
you coming in my sleep,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;did the dogs above 
bark at you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Isopel, 
&ldquo;very violently; did you think of me in your 
sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was 
thinking of Ursula and something she had told me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;When and where was that?&rdquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yesterday evening,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;beneath the 
dingle hedge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you were talking with her 
beneath the hedge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;but only upon gypsy matters.&nbsp; Do you know, Belle, 
that she has just been married to Sylvester, so you need not 
think that she and I . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She and you are 
quite at liberty to sit where you please,&rdquo; said 
Isopel.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, young man,&rdquo; she continued, 
dropping her tone, which she had slightly raised, &ldquo;I 
believe what you said, that you were merely talking about gypsy 
matters, and also what you were going to say, if it was, as I 
suppose, that she and you had no particular 
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel was now silent for some 
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;how exceedingly 
kind it was of you to get everything in readiness for me, though 
you did not know that I should come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a 
presentiment that you would come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but you 
forget that I have prepared the kettle for you before, though it 
was true I was then certain that you would come.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I had not forgotten your doing so, young man,&rdquo; said 
Belle; &ldquo;but I was beginning to think that you were utterly 
selfish, caring for nothing but the gratification of your own 
strange whims.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very fond of having my 
own way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but utterly selfish I am not, as I
dare say I shall frequently prove to you.&nbsp; You will often 
find the kettle boiling when you come home.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Not heated by you,&rdquo; said Isopel, with a sigh.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By whom else?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;surely you are not 
thinking of driving me away?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have as much
right here as myself,&rdquo; said Isopel, &ldquo;as I have told 
you before; but I must be going myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we can go together; to tell 
you the truth, I am rather tired of this place.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Our paths <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>must be separate,&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Separate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what do you 
mean?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let you go alone, I shall go with you;
and you know the road is as free to me as to you; besides, you 
can&rsquo;t think of parting company with me, considering how 
much you would lose by doing so; remember that you scarcely know 
anything of the Armenian language; now, to learn Armenian from me
would take you twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle faintly smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;take another cup of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle took another 
cup of tea, and yet another; we had some indifferent 
conversation, after which I arose and gave her donkey a 
considerable feed of corn.&nbsp; Belle thanked me, shook me by 
the hand, and then went to her own tabernacle, and I returned to 
mine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>VISIT TO THE LANDLORD&mdash;HIS MORTIFICATIONS&mdash;HUNTER 
AND HIS CLAN&mdash;RESOLUTION.</p>
<p>On the following morning, after breakfasting with Belle, who 
was silent and melancholy, I left her in the dingle, and took a 
stroll among the neighbouring lanes.&nbsp; After some time I 
thought I would pay a visit to the landlord of the public-house, 
whom I had not seen since the day when he communicated to me his 
intention of changing his religion.&nbsp; I therefore directed my
steps to the house, and on entering it found the landlord 
standing in the kitchen.&nbsp; Just then two mean-looking 
fellows, who had been drinking at one of the tables, and who 
appeared to be the only customers in the house, got up, brushed 
past the landlord, and saying in a surly tone &ldquo;We shall pay
you some time or other,&rdquo; took their departure.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they serve me now,&rdquo; said the 
landlord, with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know those 
fellows,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;since you let them go away in 
your debt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know nothing about them,&rdquo; 
said the landlord, &ldquo;save that they are a couple of 
scamps.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did you let them go away 
without paying you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had not the 
heart to stop them,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and, to tell
you the truth, everybody serves me so now, and I suppose they are
right, for a child could flog me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;behave more like a man, 
and with respect to those two fellows run after them, I will go 
with you, and if they refuse to <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>pay the 
reckoning I will help you to shake some money out of their 
clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the landlord;
&ldquo;but as they are gone, let them go on.&nbsp; What they have
drank is not of much consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the
matter with you?&rdquo; said I, staring at the landlord, who 
appeared strangely altered; his features were wild and haggard, 
his formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken in, and his 
figure had lost much of its plumpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you 
changed your religion already, and has the fellow in black 
commanded you to fast?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not changed my 
religion yet,&rdquo; said the landlord, with a kind of shudder; 
&ldquo;I am to change it publicly this day fortnight, and the 
idea of doing so&mdash;I do not mind telling you&mdash;preys much
upon my mind; moreover, the noise of the thing has got abroad, 
and everybody is laughing at me, and what&rsquo;s more, coming 
and drinking my beer, and going away without paying for it, 
whilst I feel myself like one bewitched, wishing but not daring 
to take my own part.&nbsp; Confound the fellow in black, I wish I
had never seen him! yet what can I do without him?&nbsp; The 
brewer swears that unless I pay him fifty pounds within a 
fortnight he&rsquo;ll send a distress warrant into the house, and
take all I have.&nbsp; My poor niece is crying in the room above;
and I am thinking of going into the stable and hanging myself; 
and perhaps it&rsquo;s the best thing I can do, for it&rsquo;s 
better to hang myself before selling my soul than afterwards, as 
I&rsquo;m sure I should, like Judas Iscariot, whom my poor niece,
who is somewhat religiously inclined, has been talking to me 
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;with money, but that is quite out of my power.&nbsp; 
However, I can give you a piece of advice.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t 
change your religion by any means; you can&rsquo;t hope to 
prosper if you do; and if the brewer chooses to deal hardly with 
you, let him.&nbsp; Everybody would respect you ten times more 
provided you allowed yourself to be turned into the roads rather 
than change your religion, than if you got fifty pounds for 
renouncing it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am half inclined to take 
your advice,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;only, to tell you 
the truth, I feel quite low, without any heart in 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come into the bar,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and let us have something together&mdash;you need not be 
afraid of my not paying for what I order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the bar-room, where the landlord and I discussed 
between us two bottles of strong ale, which he said were part of 
the last six which he had in his possession.&nbsp; At first he 
wished to drink sherry, but I begged him to do no <!-- page 
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>such 
thing, telling him that sherry would do him no good, under the 
present circumstances; nor, indeed, to the best of my belief 
under any, it being of all wines the one for which I entertained 
the most contempt.&nbsp; The landlord allowed himself to be 
dissuaded, and, after a glass or two of ale, confessed that 
sherry was a sickly disagreeable drink, and that he had merely 
been in the habit of taking it from an idea he had that it was 
genteel.&nbsp; Whilst quaffing our beverage, he gave me an 
account of the various mortifications to which he had of late 
been subject, dwelling with particular bitterness on the conduct 
of Hunter, who, he said, came every night and mouthed him, and 
afterwards went away without paying for what he had drank or 
smoked, in which conduct he was closely imitated by a clan of 
fellows who constantly attended him.&nbsp; After spending several
hours at the public-house I departed, not forgetting to pay for 
the two bottles of ale.&nbsp; The landlord, before I went, 
shaking me by the hand, declared that he had now made up his mind
to stick to his religion at all hazards, the more especially as 
he was convinced he should derive no good by giving it up.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE FAIR&mdash;THE LAST LESSON&mdash;THE VERB
SIRIEL.</p>
<p>It might be about five in the evening when I reached the gypsy
encampment.&nbsp; Here I found Mr. Petulengro, Tawno Chikno, 
Sylvester, and others, in a great bustle, clipping and trimming 
certain ponies and old horses which they had brought with 
them.&nbsp; On inquiring of Jasper the reason of their being so 
engaged, he informed me that they were getting the horses ready 
for a fair, which was to be held on the morrow, at a place some 
miles distant, at which they should endeavour to dispose of them,
adding&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps, brother, you will go with us, 
provided you have nothing better to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not having 
any particular engagement, I assured him that I should have great
pleasure in being of the party.&nbsp; It was agreed that we 
should start early on the following morning.&nbsp; Thereupon I 
descended into the dingle.&nbsp; Belle was sitting before the 
fire, at which the kettle was boiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you 
waiting for me?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I thought that you
would come, and I waited for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That was 
very kind,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not half so kind,&rdquo; 
said she, &ldquo;as it was of you to get everything ready for me 
in the dead of last night, when there was scarcely a chance of my
coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tea-things were brought forward, and we 
sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been far?&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merely to that public-house,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;to which you directed me on the second day of our 
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Young men should not make a 
habit of visiting public-houses,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;they 
are bad places.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They may be so to some 
people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I do not think the worst 
public-house in England could do me any harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Perhaps you are so bad already,&rdquo; said Belle, with a 
smile, &ldquo;that it would be impossible to spoil 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare you catch at my words?&rdquo; 
said I; &ldquo;come, I will make you pay for doing so&mdash;you 
shall have this evening the longest lesson in Armenian which I 
have yet inflicted upon you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may well say
inflicted,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but pray spare me.&nbsp; I 
do not wish to hear anything about Armenian, especially this 
evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why this evening?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; Belle made no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not spare 
you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;this evening I intend to make you 
conjugate an Armenian verb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, be it 
so,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;for this evening you shall 
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To command is hramahyel,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ram her ill, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I 
do not wish to begin with that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;as we have come to the verbs, we will begin 
regularly; hramahyel is a verb of the second conjugation.&nbsp; 
We will begin with the first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;First of all 
tell me,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;what a verb is?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;A part of speech,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which, according 
to the dictionary, signifies some action or passion; for example,
I command you, or I hate you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have given 
you no cause to hate me,&rdquo; said Belle, looking me 
sorrowfully in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely giving two examples,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and neither was directed at you.&nbsp; In those examples, 
to command and hate are verbs.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian there are
four conjugations of verbs; the first end in al, the second in 
yel, the third in oul, and the fourth in il.&nbsp; Now, have you 
understood me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, indeed, it will all end ill,&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or 
you will make me lose my patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have 
already made me nearly lose mine,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Let us have no unprofitable interruptions,&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The conjugations of the Armenian verbs are 
neither so numerous <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>nor so difficult as the declensions 
of the nouns; hear that, and rejoice.&nbsp; Come, we will begin 
with the verb hntal, a verb of the first conjugation, which 
signifies to rejoice.&nbsp; Come along; hntam, I rejoice; hntas, 
thou rejoicest: why don&rsquo;t you follow, Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t rejoice, whatever you may 
do,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief difficulty, 
Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I find in teaching you the 
Armenian grammar, proceeds from your applying to yourself and me 
every example I give.&nbsp; Rejoice, in this instance, is merely 
an example of an Armenian verb of the first conjugation, and has 
no more to do with your rejoicing than lal, which is also a verb 
of the first conjugation, and which signifies to weep, would have
to do with your weeping, provided I made you conjugate it.&nbsp; 
Come along; hntam, I rejoice; hntas, thou rejoicest; hnt&agrave;,
he rejoices; hntamk, we rejoice: now, repeat those 
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;they sound 
more like the language of horses than of human beings.&nbsp; Do 
you take me for . . .?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; Belle was silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you going to say 
mare?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mare! mare! by-the-bye, do you 
know, Belle, that mare in old English stands for woman; and that 
when we call a female an evil mare, the strict meaning of the 
term is merely bad woman.&nbsp; So if I were to call you mare, 
without prefixing bad, you must not be offended.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But I should, though,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
was merely attempting to make you acquainted with a philological 
fact,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;If mare, which in old English, 
and likewise in vulgar English, signifies a woman, sounds the 
same as mare, which in modern and polite English signifies a 
female horse, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; There is no such 
confusion of sounds in Armenian, not, at least, in the same 
instance.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian, woman is ghin, the same word,
by-the-bye, a sour queen, whereas mare is madagh tzi, which 
signifies a female horse; and perhaps you will permit me to add, 
that a hard-mouthed jade is, in Armenian, madagh tzi 
hsdierah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this much longer,&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep yourself quiet,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I 
wish to be gentle with you; and to convince you, we will skip 
hntal, and also for the present verbs of the first conjugation, 
and proceed to the second.&nbsp; Belle, I will now select for you
to conjugate the prettiest verb in Armenian; not only of the 
second, but also of all the four conjugations; that is 
siriel.&nbsp; Here is the present tense:&mdash;siriem, siries, 
sir&egrave;, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>siriemk, sir&egrave;k, sirien.&nbsp; 
You observe that it runs on just in the same manner as hntal, 
save and except that e is substituted for a; and it will be as 
well to tell you that almost the only difference between the 
second, third, and fourth conjugations, and the first, is the 
substituting in the present, preterite, and other tenses e, or 
ou, or i for a; so you see that the Armenian verbs are by no 
means difficult.&nbsp; Come on, Belle, and say 
siriem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray oblige 
me, Belle, by saying siriem!&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle still appeared to
hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must admit, Belle, that it is much 
softer than hntam.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said 
Belle; &ldquo;and to oblige you, I will say siriem.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Very well indeed, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No 
vartabied, or doctor, could have pronounced it better; and now, 
to show you how verbs act upon pronouns in Armenian, I will say 
siriem zkiez.&nbsp; Please to repeat siriem zkiez!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Siriem zkiez!&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;that last word is 
very hard to say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry that you think so, 
Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now please to say siri&aacute;
zis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle did so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Exceedingly 
well,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now say yerani th&egrave; 
sir&egrave;ir zis.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yerani th&egrave; 
sir&egrave;ir zis,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have now said, I love 
you&mdash;love me&mdash;ah! would that you would love 
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have said all these things?&rdquo; said 
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have said them
in Armenian.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have said them in no 
language that I understood,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and it was 
very wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance, and make me 
say such things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;if you said them, I said them too.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
did so,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I believe you were merely 
bantering and jeering.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As I told you before, 
Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the chief difficulty which I find in
teaching you Armenian proceeds from your persisting in applying 
to yourself and me every example I give.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
you meant nothing after all?&rdquo; said Belle, raising her 
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us proceed,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;sirietsi, I loved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You never loved any
one but yourself,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more
. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirietsits, I will love,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;sirietsies, thou wilt love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never one 
so thoroughly heartless,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell 
you what, Belle, you are becoming intolerable, but we will change
the verb; or rather I will now proceed to tell you here, that 
some of the Armenian conjugations have their anomalies; one 
species of these I wish to bring before your notice.&nbsp; As old
Villotte says&mdash;from whose work I first contrived to pick up 
the rudiments of Armenian&mdash;&lsquo;Est verborum 
transitivorum, <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>quorum infinitivus . . .&rsquo; but I
forgot, you don&rsquo;t understand Latin.&nbsp; He says there are
certain transitive verbs, whose infinitive is in outsaniel; the 
preterite in outsi; the imperative in oue; for 
example&mdash;parghatsoutsaniem, I irritate . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, you do,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and it will 
be better for both of us if you leave off doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would hardly believe, Belle,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;that the Armenian is in some respects closely connected 
with the Irish, but so it is; for example, that word 
parghatsoutsaniem is evidently derived from the same root as 
feargaim, which, in Irish, is as much as to say I vex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O man, man!&rdquo; said Belle, bursting into tears, 
&ldquo;for what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a 
question, unless it be to vex and irritate her?&nbsp; If you wish
to display your learning, do so to the wise and instructed, and 
not to me, who can scarcely read or write.&nbsp; Oh, leave off 
your nonsense; yet I know you will not do so, for it is the 
breath of your nostrils!&nbsp; I could have wished we should have
parted in kindness, but you will not permit it.&nbsp; I have 
deserved better at your hands than such treatment.&nbsp; The 
whole time we have kept company together in this place, I have 
scarcely had one kind word from you, but the strangest&rdquo; . .
. and here the voice of Belle was drowned in her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to see you take on so, dear Belle,&rdquo; 
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really have given you no cause to be so 
unhappy; surely teaching you a little Armenian was a very 
innocent kind of diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you went on so long, and in such a strange 
way, and made me repeat such strange examples, as you call them, 
that I could not bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Belle, it&rsquo;s my way; 
and I have dealt with you just as I would with . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard-mouthed jade,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and you 
practising your horse-witchery upon her.&nbsp; I have been of an 
unsubdued spirit, I acknowledge, but I was always kind to you; 
and if you have made me cry, it&rsquo;s a poor thing to boast 
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boast of!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;a pretty thing indeed 
to boast of; I had no idea of making you cry.&nbsp; Come, I beg 
your pardon; what more can I do?&nbsp; Come, cheer up, 
Belle.&nbsp; You were talking of parting; don&rsquo;t let us 
part, but depart, and that together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ways lie different,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they should,&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let us be off to America 
together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To America together?&rdquo; said Belle, looking full at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where we will settle down in
some forest, and conjugate the verb siriel conjugally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjugally?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;as man and wife in America, 
air yew ghin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting, as usual,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, indeed.&nbsp; Come, Belle, make up your mind, 
and let us be off to America; and leave priests, humbug, 
learning, and languages behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are jesting,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;but I can hardly entertain your offers; however, young 
man, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better make up your mind at once,&rdquo; said 
I, &ldquo;and let us be off.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t make a bad 
husband, I assure you.&nbsp; Perhaps you think I am not worthy of
you?&nbsp; To convince you, Belle, that I am, I am ready to try a
fall with you this moment upon the grass.&nbsp; Brynhilda, the 
valkyrie, swore that no one should marry her who could not fling 
her down.&nbsp; Perhaps you have done the same.&nbsp; The man who
eventually married her, got a friend of his, who was called 
Sygurd, the serpent-killer, to wrestle with her, disguising him 
in his own armour.&nbsp; Sygurd flung her down, and won her for 
his friend, though he loved her himself.&nbsp; I shall not use a 
similar deceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate 
me&mdash;so get up, Belle, and I will do my best to fling you 
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I require no such thing of you, or anybody,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;you are beginning to look rather wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I every now and then do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come, 
Belle, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say nothing at present on the subject,&rdquo; 
said Belle; &ldquo;I must have time to consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;to-morrow I 
go to a fair with Mr. Petulengro, perhaps you will consider 
whilst I am away.&nbsp; Come, Belle, let us have some more 
tea.&nbsp; I wonder whether we shall be able to procure tea as 
good as this in the American forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE DAWN OF DAY&mdash;THE LAST FAREWELL&mdash;DEPARTURE FOR 
THE FAIR&mdash;THE FINE HORSE&mdash;RETURN TO THE DINGLE&mdash;NO
ISOPEL.</p>
<p>It was about the dawn of day when I was awakened by the voice 
of Mr. Petulengro shouting from the top of the dingle, and 
bidding me get up.&nbsp; I arose instantly, and dressed myself 
for the expedition to the fair.&nbsp; On leaving my tent, I was 
surprised to observe Belle, entirely dressed, standing close to 
her own little encampment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;I little expected to find you up so early.&nbsp; I suppose
Jasper&rsquo;s call awakened you, as it did me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I merely lay down in my things,&rdquo; said Belle, 
&ldquo;and have not slept during the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And why did you not take off your things and go to 
sleep?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not undress,&rdquo; said
Belle, &ldquo;because I wished to be in readiness to bid you 
farewell when you departed; and as for sleeping, I could 
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, God bless you!&rdquo; said I, 
taking Belle by the hand.&nbsp; Belle made no answer, and I 
observed that her hand was very cold.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the 
matter with you?&rdquo; said I, looking her in the face.&nbsp; 
Belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes, and then cast down 
her own&mdash;her features were very pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are 
really unwell,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I had better not go to the 
fair, but stay here, and take care of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;pray go, I am not 
unwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then go to your tent,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and do not endanger your health by standing abroad in the 
raw morning air.&nbsp; God bless you, Belle; I shall be home 
to-night, by which time I expect you will have made up your mind;
if not, another lesson in Armenian, however late the hour 
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then wrung Belle&rsquo;s hand, and ascended to
the plain above.</p>
<p>I found the Romany party waiting for me, and everything in 
readiness for departing.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno 
were mounted on two old horses.&nbsp; The rest who intended to go
to the fair, amongst whom were two or three women, were on 
foot.&nbsp; On arriving at the extremity of the plain, I looked 
towards the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the 
beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and 
figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand towards her.&nbsp; She slowly 
lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away, and never saw 
Isopel Berners again.</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>My companions and myself proceeded on our way.&nbsp; In 
about two hours we reached the place where the fair was to be 
held.&nbsp; After breakfasting on bread and cheese and ale behind
a broken stone wall, we drove our animals to the fair.&nbsp; The 
fair was a common cattle and horse fair: there was little 
merriment going on, but there was no lack of business.&nbsp; By 
about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Mr. Petulengro and his 
people had disposed of their animals at what they conceived very 
fair prices&mdash;they were all in high spirits, and Jasper 
proposed to adjourn to a public-house.&nbsp; As we were 
proceeding to one, a very fine horse, led by a jockey, made its 
appearance on the ground.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro stopped short, and
looked at it steadfastly: &ldquo;Fino covar dove odoy sas 
miro&mdash;a fine thing were that, if it were but mine!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you covet it,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;why do you not purchase it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We low 
gyptians never buy animals of that description; if we did we 
could never sell them, and most likely should be had up as 
horse-stealers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did you say just 
now, &lsquo;It were a fine thing if it were but 
yours&rsquo;?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We gyptians always say 
so when we see anything that we admire.&nbsp; An animal like that
is not intended for a little hare like me, but for some grand 
gentleman like yourself.&nbsp; I say, brother, do you buy that 
horse!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should I buy the horse, you 
foolish person?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy the horse, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;if you have not the 
money I can lend it you, though I be of lower Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You talk nonsense,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;however, I wish 
you would ask the man the price of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Petulengro, going up to the jockey, inquired the price of the 
horse&mdash;the man, looking at him scornfully, made no 
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said I, going up to the 
jockey, &ldquo;do me the favour to tell me the price of that 
horse, as I suppose it is to sell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jockey, who 
was a surly-looking man of about fifty, looked at me for a 
moment, then, after some hesitation, said laconically, 
&ldquo;Seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, and
turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy that horse,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro, coming after me; &ldquo;the dook tells me that in 
less than three months he will be sold for twice 
seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with 
him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;besides, Jasper, I don&rsquo;t like 
his tail.&nbsp; Did you observe what a mean scrubby tail he 
has?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a fool you are, brother!&rdquo; 
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that very tail of his shows his 
breeding.&nbsp; No good bred horse ever yet carried a fine 
tail&mdash;&rsquo;tis your scrubby-tailed horses that are your 
out-and-outers.&nbsp; <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Did you ever hear of Syntax, 
brother?&nbsp; That tail of his puts me in mind of Syntax.&nbsp; 
Well, I say nothing more, have your own way&mdash;all I wonder at
is, that a horse like him was ever brought to such a fair of dog 
cattle as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then made the best of our way to a public-house, where we 
had some refreshment.&nbsp; I then proposed returning to the 
encampment, but Mr. Petulengro declined, and remained drinking 
with his companions till about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, 
when various jockeys from the fair came in.&nbsp; After some 
conversation a jockey proposed a game of cards; and in a little 
time, Mr. Petulengro and another gypsy sat down to play a game of
cards with two of the jockeys.</p>
<p>Though not much acquainted with cards, I soon conceived a 
suspicion that the jockeys were cheating Mr. Petulengro and his 
companion, I therefore called Mr. Petulengro aside, and gave him 
a hint to that effect.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, however, instead of 
thanking me, told me to mind my own bread and butter, and 
forthwith returned to his game.&nbsp; I continued watching the 
players for some hours.&nbsp; The gypsies lost considerably, and 
I saw clearly that the jockeys were cheating them most 
confoundedly.&nbsp; I therefore once more called Mr. Petulengro 
aside, and told him that the jockeys were cheating him, conjuring
him to return to the encampment.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, who was by
this time somewhat the worse for liquor, now fell into a passion,
swore several oaths, and asking me who had made me a Moses over 
him and his brethren, told me to return to the encampment by 
myself.&nbsp; Incensed at the unworthy return which my well-meant
words had received, I forthwith left the house, and having 
purchased a few articles of provision, I set out for the dingle 
alone.&nbsp; It was dark night when I reached it, and descending 
I saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of the dingle; my 
heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Isopel Berners is waiting for me,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and the first word that I shall hear from her lips is that
she has made up her mind.&nbsp; We shall go to America, and be so
happy together.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reaching the bottom of the 
dingle, however, I saw seated near the fire, beside which stood 
the kettle simmering, not Isopel Berners, but a gypsy girl, who 
told me that Miss Berners when she went away had charged her to 
keep up the fire, and have the kettle boiling against my 
arrival.&nbsp; Startled at these words, I inquired at what hour 
Isopel had left, and whither she had gone, and was told that she 
had <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>left the dingle, with her cart, about two hours after I 
departed; but where she was gone the girl did not know.&nbsp; I 
then asked whether she had left no message, and the girl replied 
that she had left none, but had merely given directions about the
kettle and fire, putting, at the same time, sixpence into her 
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; thought I; then 
dismissing the gypsy girl I sat down by the fire.&nbsp; I had no 
wish for tea, but sat looking on the embers, wondering what could
be the motive of the sudden departure of Isopel.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Does she mean to return?&rdquo; thought I to myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely she means to return,&rdquo; Hope replied, &ldquo;or
she would not have gone away without leaving any 
message&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and yet she could scarcely mean to 
return,&rdquo; muttered Foreboding, &ldquo;or she would assuredly
have left some message with the girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then thought
to myself what a hard thing it would be, if, after having made up
my mind to assume the yoke of matrimony, I should be disappointed
of the woman of my choice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, after all,&rdquo; 
thought I, &ldquo;I can scarcely be disappointed; if such an ugly
scoundrel as Sylvester had no difficulty in getting such a nice 
wife as Ursula, surely I, who am not a tenth part so ugly, cannot
fail to obtain the hand of Isopel Berners, uncommonly fine damsel
though she be.&nbsp; Husbands do not grow upon hedge rows; she is
merely gone after a little business and will return 
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings, I 
retired to my tent, and went to sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>GLOOMY FOREBODINGS&mdash;THE POSTMAN&rsquo;S MOTHER&mdash;THE 
LETTER&mdash;BEARS AND BARONS&mdash;THE BEST OF ADVICE.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred to me of any particular moment during the 
following day.&nbsp; Isopel Berners did not return; but Mr. 
Petulengro and his companions came home from the fair early in 
the morning.&nbsp; When I saw him, which was about midday, I 
found him with his face bruised and swelled.&nbsp; It appeared 
that, some time after I had left him, he himself perceived that 
the jockeys with whom he was playing cards were cheating him and 
his companion; a quarrel ensued, which terminated in a fight 
between Mr. Petulengro and one of the jockeys, which lasted <!-- 
page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>some time, and in which Mr. Petulengro, though he 
eventually came off victor, was considerably beaten.&nbsp; His 
bruises, in conjunction with his pecuniary loss, which amounted 
to about seven pounds, were the cause of his being much out of 
humour; before night, however, he had returned to his usual 
philosophic frame of mind, and, coming up to me as I was walking 
about, apologised for his behaviour on the preceding day, and 
assured me that he was determined, from that time forward, never 
to quarrel with a friend for giving him good advice.</p>
<p>Two more days passed, and still Isopel Berners did not 
return.&nbsp; Gloomy thoughts and forebodings filled my 
mind.&nbsp; During the day I wandered about the neighbouring 
roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse of her and her 
returning vehicle; and at night lay awake, tossing about on my 
hard couch, listening to the rustle of every leaf, and 
occasionally thinking that I heard the sound of her wheels upon 
the distant road.&nbsp; Once at midnight, just as I was about to 
fall into unconsciousness, I suddenly started up, for I was 
convinced that I heard the sound of wheels.&nbsp; I listened most
anxiously, and the sound of wheels striking against stones was 
certainly plain enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;She comes at last,&rdquo; 
thought I, and for a few moments I felt as if a mountain had been
removed from my breast;&mdash;&ldquo;here she comes at last, now,
how shall I receive her?&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I 
will receive her rather coolly, just as if I was not particularly
anxious about her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to manage these 
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next moment the sound became very loud, 
rather too loud, I thought, to proceed from her wheels, and then 
by degrees became fainter.&nbsp; Rushing out of my tent, I 
hurried up the path to the top of the dingle, where I heard the 
sound distinctly enough, but it was going from me, and evidently 
proceeded from something much larger than the cart of 
Isopel.&nbsp; I could, moreover, hear the stamping of a 
horse&rsquo;s hoofs at a lumbering trot.&nbsp; Those only whose 
hopes have been wrought up to a high pitch, and then suddenly 
dashed down, can imagine what I felt at that moment; and yet when
I returned to my lonely tent, and lay down on my hard pallet, the
voice of conscience told me that the misery I was then 
undergoing, I had fully merited, from the unkind manner in which 
I had intended to receive her, when for a brief minute I supposed
that she had returned.</p>
<p>It was on the morning after this affair, and the fourth, if I 
forget not, from the time of Isopel&rsquo;s departure, that, as I
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>was seated on my stone at the bottom of the dingle, 
getting my breakfast, I heard an unknown voice from the path 
above&mdash;apparently that of a person descending&mdash;exclaim,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a strange place to bring a letter to;&rdquo; 
and presently an old woman, with a belt round her middle, to 
which was attached a leathern bag, made her appearance, and stood
before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I ever!&rdquo; said she, as she looked about 
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;My good gentlewoman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pray
what may you please to want?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Gentlewoman!&rdquo; said the old dame, &ldquo;please to 
want!&mdash;well, I call that speaking civilly, at any 
rate.&nbsp; It is true, civil words cost nothing; nevertheless, 
we do not always get them.&nbsp; What I please to want is to 
deliver a letter to a young man in this place; perhaps you be 
he?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name on the 
letter?&rdquo; said I, getting up and going to her.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There is no name upon it,&rdquo; said she, taking a letter
out of her scrip and looking at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is directed 
to the young man in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Then it is for me, I make no doubt,&rdquo; said I, 
stretching out my hand to take it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please to pay me 
ninepence first,&rdquo; said the old woman.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said she, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, 
&ldquo;civility is civility, and, being rather a scarce article, 
should meet with some return.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the letter, 
young man, and I hope you will pay for it; for if you do not, I 
must pay the postage myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the 
postwoman, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, as I took the letter.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am the postman&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; said the old 
woman; &ldquo;but as he has a wide beat, I help him as much as I 
can, and I generally carry letters to places like this, to which 
he is afraid to come himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You say the 
postage is ninepence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a 
shilling.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call that 
honourable,&rdquo; said the old woman, taking the shilling and 
putting it into her pocket&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s your change,
young man,&rdquo; said she, offering me threepence.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pray keep that for yourself,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you 
deserve it for your trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call 
that genteel,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;and as one good 
turn deserves another, since you look as if you couldn&rsquo;t 
read, I will read your letter for you.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see it; 
it&rsquo;s from some young woman or other, I dare 
say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I 
can read.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All the better for you,&rdquo; said
the old woman; &ldquo;your being able to read will frequently 
save you a penny, for that&rsquo;s the charge I generally make 
for reading letters; though, as you behaved so genteelly to me, I
should have charged you nothing.&nbsp; Well, if you can read, why
don&rsquo;t you open the letter, instead of keeping it hanging 
between your finger and thumb?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in no 
hurry to <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>open it,&rdquo; said I, with a 
sigh.&nbsp; The old woman looked at me for a 
moment&mdash;&ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; said she, 
&ldquo;there are some&mdash;especially those who can 
read&mdash;who don&rsquo;t like to open their letters when 
anybody is by, more especially when they come from young 
women.&nbsp; Well, I won&rsquo;t intrude upon you, but leave you 
alone with your letter.&nbsp; I wish it may contain something 
pleasant.&nbsp; God bless you,&rdquo; and with these words she 
departed.</p>
<p>I sat down on my stone, with my letter in my hand.&nbsp; I 
knew perfectly well that it could have come from no other person 
than Isopel Berners; but what did the letter contain?&nbsp; I 
guessed tolerably well what its purport was&mdash;an eternal 
farewell! yet I was afraid to open the letter, lest my 
expectation should be confirmed.&nbsp; There I sat with the 
letter, putting off the evil moment as long as possible.&nbsp; At
length I glanced at the direction, which was written in a fine 
bold hand, and was directed, as the old woman had said, to the 
young man in &ldquo;Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle,&rdquo; with the 
addition, &ldquo;near . . ., in the county of . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Suddenly the idea occurred to me, that, after all, the letter 
might not contain an eternal farewell; and that Isopel might have
written, requesting me to join her.&nbsp; Could it be so?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; presently said Foreboding.&nbsp; At last 
I became ashamed of my weakness.&nbsp; The letter must be opened 
sooner or later.&nbsp; Why not at once?&nbsp; So as the bather 
who, for a considerable time has stood shivering on the bank, 
afraid to take the decisive plunge, suddenly takes it, I tore 
open the letter almost before I was aware.&nbsp; I had no sooner 
done so than a paper fell out.&nbsp; I examined it; it contained 
a lock of bright flaxen hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no good 
sign,&rdquo; said I, as I thrust the lock and paper into my 
bosom, and proceeded to read the letter, which ran as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;TO THE YOUNG MAN IN MUMPER&rsquo;S 
DINGLE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I send these lines, with the hope and trust 
that they will find you well, even as I am myself at this moment,
and in much better spirits, for my own are not such as I could 
wish they were, being sometimes rather hysterical and vapourish, 
and at other times, and most often, very low.&nbsp; I am at a 
sea-port, and am just going on shipboard; and when you get these 
I shall be on the salt waters, on my way to a distant country, 
and leaving my own behind me, which I do not expect ever to see 
again.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;And now, young man, I will, in the first place, 
say something about the manner in which I quitted you.&nbsp; It 
must have seemed somewhat singular to you that I went away 
without taking any leave, or giving you the slightest hint that I
was going; but I did not do so without considerable 
reflection.&nbsp; I was afraid that I should not be able to 
support a leave-taking; and as you had said that you were 
determined to go wherever I did, I thought it best not to tell 
you at all; for I did not think it advisable that you should go 
with me, and I wished to have no dispute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, I wish to say something about an 
offer of wedlock which you made me; perhaps, young man, had you 
made it at the first period of our acquaintance, I should have 
accepted it, but you did not, and kept putting off and putting 
off, and behaving in a very strange manner, till I could stand 
your conduct no longer, but determined upon leaving you and Old 
England, which last step I had been long thinking about; so when 
you made your offer at last, everything was arranged&mdash;my 
cart and donkey engaged to be sold&mdash;and the greater part of 
my things disposed of.&nbsp; However, young man, when you did 
make it, I frankly tell you that I had half a mind to accept it; 
at last, however, after very much consideration, I thought it 
best to leave you for ever, because, for some time past, I had 
become almost convinced, that though with a wonderful deal of 
learning, and exceedingly shrewd in some things, you 
were&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;at the root mad! 
and though mad people, I have been told, sometimes make very good
husbands, I was unwilling that your friends, if you had any, 
should say that Belle Berners, the workhouse girl, took advantage
of your infirmity; for there is no concealing that I was born and
bred up in a workhouse; notwithstanding that, my blood is better 
than your own, and as good as the best; you having yourself told 
me that my name is a noble name, and once, if I mistake not, that
it was the same word as baron, which is the same thing as bear; 
and that to be called in old times a bear was considered as a 
great compliment&mdash;the bear being a mighty strong animal, on 
which account our forefathers called all their great fighting-men
barons, which is the same as bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, setting matters of blood and family entirely 
aside, many thanks to you, young man, from poor Belle, for the 
honour you did her in making that same offer; for, after all, it 
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>is an honour to receive an honourable offer, which she 
could see clearly yours was, with no floriness nor chaff in it; 
but, on the contrary, entire sincerity.&nbsp; She assures you 
that she shall always bear it and yourself in mind, whether on 
land or water; and as a proof of the good-will she bears to you, 
she has sent you a lock of the hair which she wears on her head, 
which you were often looking at, and were pleased to call flax, 
which word she supposes you meant as a compliment, even as the 
old people meant to pass a compliment to their great folks when 
they called them bears; though she cannot help thinking that they
might have found an animal as strong as a bear, and somewhat less
uncouth, to call their great folks after: even as she thinks 
yourself, amongst your great store of words, might have found 
something a little more genteel to call her hair after than flax,
which, though strong and useful, is rather a coarse and common 
kind of article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as another proof of the goodwill she bears to you, 
she sends you, along with the lock, a piece of advice, which is 
worth all the hair in the world, to say nothing of the flax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fear God</i>, and take your own part.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s Bible in that, young man; see how Moses feared God,
and how he took his own part against everybody who meddled with 
him.&nbsp; And see how David feared God, and took his own part 
against all the bloody enemies which surrounded him&mdash;so fear
God, young man, and never give in!&nbsp; The world can bully, and
is fond, provided it sees a man in a kind of difficulty, of 
getting about him, calling him coarse names, and even going so 
far as to hustle him; but the world, like all bullies, carries a 
white feather in its tail, and no sooner sees the man taking off 
his coat, and offering to fight its best, than it scatters here 
and there, and is always civil to him afterwards.&nbsp; So when 
folks are disposed to ill-treat you, young man, say &lsquo;Lord, 
have mercy upon me!&rsquo; and then tip them Long Melford, to 
which, as the saying goes, there is nothing comparable for 
shortness all the world over; and these last words, young man, 
are the last you will ever have from her who is, 
nevertheless,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your affectionate female 
servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Isopel Berners</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading the letter I sat for some time motionless, 
holding it in my hand.&nbsp; The day-dream in which I had been a 
little time before indulging, of marrying Isopel Berners, of <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>going with her to America, and having by her a large 
progeny, who were to assist me in felling trees, cultivating the 
soil, and who would take care of me when I was old, was now 
thoroughly dispelled.&nbsp; Isopel had deserted me, and was gone 
to America by herself, where, perhaps, she would marry some other
person, and would bear him a progeny, who would do for him what 
in my dream I had hoped my progeny by her would do for me.&nbsp; 
Then the thought came into my head that though she was gone I 
might follow her to America, but then I thought that if I did I 
might not find her; America was a very large place, and I did not
know the port to which she was bound; but I could follow her to 
the port from which she had sailed, and there possibly discover 
the port to which she was bound; but then I did not even know the
port from which she had set out, for Isopel had not dated her 
letter from any place.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to me that the 
post-mark on the letter would tell me from whence it came, so I 
forthwith looked at the back of the letter, and in the post-mark 
read the name of a well-known and not very distant sea 
port.&nbsp; I then knew with tolerable certainty the port where 
she had embarked, and I almost determined to follow her, but I 
almost instantly determined to do no such thing.&nbsp; Isopel 
Berners had abandoned me, and I would not follow her; 
&ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; whispered Pride, &ldquo;if I overtook her,
she would only despise me for running after her;&rdquo; and it 
also told me pretty roundly that, provided I ran after her, 
whether I overtook her or not, I should heartily despise 
myself.&nbsp; So I determined not to follow Isopel Berners; I 
took her lock of hair, and looked at it, then put it in her 
letter, which I folded up and carefully stowed away, resolved to 
keep both for ever, but I determined not to follow her.&nbsp; Two
or three times, however, during the day I wavered in my 
determination, and was again and again almost tempted to follow 
her, but every succeeding time the temptation was fainter.&nbsp; 
In the evening I left the dingle, and sat down with Mr. 
Petulengro and his family by the door of his tent; Mr. Petulengro
soon began talking of the letter which I had received in the 
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not from Miss Berners, 
brother?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; I told him it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
she coming back, brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said 
I; &ldquo;she is gone to America, and has deserted 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I always knew that you two were never 
destined for each other,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you
know that?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dook told me so, 
brother; you are born to be a great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- 
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I had gone with 
her to America, as I was thinking of doing, I should have been a 
great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are to travel in another
direction, brother,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would
tell me all about my future wanderings,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, 
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a power of clouds before my 
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a poor seer, after all,&rdquo; 
said I, and getting up, I retired to my dingle and my tent, where
I betook myself to my bed, and there, knowing the worst, and 
being no longer agitated by apprehension, nor agonised by 
expectation, I was soon buried in a deep slumber, the first which
I had fallen into for several nights.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>THE PUBLIC-HOUSE&mdash;LANDLORD ON HIS LEGS AGAIN&mdash;A BLOW
IN SEASON&mdash;THE WAY OF THE WORLD&mdash;THE GRATEFUL 
MIND&mdash;THE HORSE&rsquo;S NEIGH.</p>
<p>It was rather late on the following morning when I 
awoke.&nbsp; At first I was almost unconscious of what had 
occurred on the preceding day; recollection, however, by degrees 
returned, and I felt a deep melancholy coming over me, but 
perfectly aware that no advantage could be derived from the 
indulgence of such a feeling, I sprang up, prepared my breakfast,
which I ate with a tolerable appetite, and then left the dingle, 
and betook myself to the gypsy encampment, where I entered into 
discourse with various Romanies, both male and female.&nbsp; 
After some time, feeling myself in better spirits, I determined 
to pay another visit to the landlord of the public-house.&nbsp; 
From the position of his affairs when I had last visited him, I 
entertained rather gloomy ideas with respect to his present 
circumstances.&nbsp; I imagined that I should either find him 
alone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or in company with 
some surly bailiff or his follower, whom his friend the brewer 
had sent into the house in order to take possession of his 
effects.</p>
<p>Nothing more entirely differing from either of these 
anticipations could have presented itself to my view than what I 
saw about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when I entered the 
house.&nbsp; I had come, though somewhat in want of consolation 
myself, to offer any consolation which was at my command to <!-- 
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>my acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps like many other 
people who go to a house with &ldquo;drops of compassion 
trembling on their eyelids,&rdquo; I felt rather disappointed at 
finding that no compassion was necessary.&nbsp; The house was 
thronged with company, the cries for ale and porter, hot brandy 
and water, cold gin and water, were numerous; moreover, no desire
to receive and not to pay for the landlord&rsquo;s liquids was 
manifested&mdash;on the contrary, everybody seemed disposed to 
play the most honourable part: &ldquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the 
money for this glass of brandy and water&mdash;do me the favour 
to take it; all right, remember I have paid you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the money for the pint of 
half-and-half&mdash;fourpence halfpenny, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t 
it?&mdash;here&rsquo;s sixpence; keep the change&mdash;confound 
the change!&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord, assisted by his niece, 
bustled about; his brow erect, his cheeks plumped out, and all 
his features exhibiting a kind of surly satisfaction.&nbsp; 
Wherever he moved, marks of the most cordial amity were shown 
him, hands were thrust out to grasp his, nor were looks of 
respect, admiration, nay almost of adoration, wanting.&nbsp; I 
observed one fellow, as the landlord advanced, take the pipe out 
of his mouth, and gaze upon him with a kind of grin of wonder, 
probably much the same as his ancestor, the Saxon lout of old, 
put on when he saw his idol Thur dressed in a new kirtle.&nbsp; 
To avoid the press, I got into a corner, where, on a couple of 
chairs, sat two respectable-looking individuals, whether farmers 
or sow-gelders, I know not, but highly respectable-looking, who 
were discoursing about the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such 
another,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;you will not find in a 
summer&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, nor in the whole of 
England,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom of 
Hopton,&rdquo; said the first: &ldquo;ah! Tom of Hopton,&rdquo; 
echoed the other; &ldquo;the man who could beat Tom of Hopton 
could beat the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I glory in him,&rdquo; 
said the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said the second; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back him against the world.&nbsp; Let me hear 
any one say anything against him, and if I don&rsquo;t . . 
.&rdquo; then, looking at me, he added, &ldquo;have you anything 
to say against him, young man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a 
word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;save that he regularly puts me 
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll put any one out,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;any one out of conceit with himself;&rdquo; then,
lifting a mug to his mouth, he added, with a hiccough, &ldquo;I 
drink his health.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presently the landlord, as he 
moved about, observing me, stopped short: &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;are you here?&nbsp; I am glad to see you, come this 
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said he to his 
company, as I followed him to the bar, &ldquo;stand back for me 
and <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>his gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two or 
three young fellows were in the bar, seemingly sporting yokels, 
drinking sherry and smoking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, gentlemen,&rdquo;
said the landlord, &ldquo;clear the bar, I must have a clear bar 
for me and my friend here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Landlord, what 
will you take,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;a glass of sherry?&nbsp; I
know you like it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;. . . sherry and you 
too,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I want neither sherry nor 
yourself; didn&rsquo;t you hear what I told you?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; said the other, shaking the 
landlord by the hand, &ldquo;all right, don&rsquo;t wish to 
intrude&mdash;but I suppose when you and your friend have done, I
may come in again;&rdquo; then, with &ldquo;a sarvant, 
sir,&rdquo; to me, he took himself into the kitchen, followed by 
the rest of the sporting yokels.</p>
<p>Thereupon the landlord, taking a bottle of ale from a basket, 
uncorked it, and pouring the contents into two large glasses, 
handed me one, and motioning me to sit down, placed himself by 
me; then, emptying his own glass at a draught, he gave a kind of 
grunt of satisfaction, and fixing his eyes upon the opposite side
of the bar, remained motionless, without saying a word, buried 
apparently in important cogitations.&nbsp; With respect to 
myself, I swallowed my ale more leisurely, and was about to 
address my friend, when his niece, coming into the bar, said that
more and more customers were arriving, and how she should supply 
their wants she did not know, unless her uncle would get up and 
help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The customers!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;let the
scoundrels wait till you have time to serve them, or till I have 
leisure to see after them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The kitchen 
won&rsquo;t contain half of them,&rdquo; said his niece.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Then let them sit out abroad,&rdquo; said the 
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there are not benches enough, 
uncle,&rdquo; said the niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then let them stand or
sit on the ground,&rdquo; said the uncle, &ldquo;what care 
I?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let them know that the man who beat Tom of 
Hopton stands as well again on his legs as ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then opening a side door which led from the bar into the back 
yard, he beckoned me to follow him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You treat your 
customers in rather a cavalier manner,&rdquo; said I, when we 
were alone together in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and 
I&rsquo;ll treat them more so yet; now I have got the whip-hand 
of the rascals I intend to keep it.&nbsp; I dare say you are a 
bit surprised with regard to the change which has come over 
things since you were last here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you how it
happened.&nbsp; You remember in what a desperate condition you 
found me, thinking of changing <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>my 
religion, selling my soul to the man in black, and then going and
hanging myself like Pontius Pilate; and I dare say you 
can&rsquo;t have forgotten how you gave me good advice, made me 
drink ale, and give up sherry.&nbsp; Well, after you were gone, I
felt all the better for your talk, and what you had made me 
drink, and it was a mercy that I did feel better; for my niece 
was gone out, poor thing, and I was left alone in the house, 
without a soul to look at, or to keep me from doing myself a 
mischief in case I was so inclined.&nbsp; Well, things wore on in
this way till it grew dusk, when in came that blackguard Hunter 
with his train to drink at my expense, and to insult me as usual;
there were more than a dozen of them, and a pretty set they 
looked.&nbsp; Well, they ordered about in a very free and easy 
manner for upwards of an hour and a half, occasionally sneering 
and jeering at me, as they had been in the habit of doing for 
some time past; so, as I said before, things wore on, and other 
customers came in, who, though they did not belong to 
Hunter&rsquo;s gang, also passed off their jokes upon me; for, as
you perhaps know, we English are a set of low hounds, who will 
always take part with the many by way of making ourselves safe, 
and currying favour with the stronger side.&nbsp; I said little 
or nothing, for my spirits had again become very low, and I was 
verily scared and afraid.&nbsp; All of a sudden I thought of the 
ale which I had drank in the morning, and of the good it did me 
then, so I went into the bar, opened another bottle, took a 
glass, and felt better; so I took another, and feeling better 
still, I went back into the kitchen just as Hunter and his crew 
were about leaving.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Hunter,&rsquo; said I, 
&lsquo;you and your people will please to pay me for what you 
have had?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you mean by my 
people?&rsquo; said he, with an oath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! what do 
you mean by calling us his people?&rsquo; said the clan.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We are nobody&rsquo;s people;&rsquo; and then there was a 
pretty load of abuse, and threatening to serve me out.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I was perhaps wrong to call 
them your people, and beg your pardon and theirs.&nbsp; And now 
you will please to pay me for what you have had yourself, and 
afterwards I can settle with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall 
pay you when I think fit,&rsquo; said Hunter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the rest, &lsquo;and so shall we.&nbsp; 
We shall pay you when we think fit.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell 
you what,&rsquo; said Hunter, &lsquo;I conceives I do such an old
fool as you an honour when I comes into his house and drinks his 
beer, and goes away without paying for it;&rsquo; and then there 
was a roar of laughter from everybody, and <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>almost all 
said the same thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now do you please to pay me Mr.
Hunter?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pay you!&rsquo; said Hunter; 
&lsquo;pay you!&nbsp; Yes, here&rsquo;s the pay;&rsquo; and 
thereupon he held out his thumb, twirling it round till it just 
touched my nose.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you what I felt that 
moment; a kind of madhouse thrill came upon me, and all I know 
is, that I bent back as far as I could, then lunging out, struck 
him under the ear, sending him reeling two or three yards, when 
he fell on the floor.&nbsp; I wish you had but seen how my 
company looked at me and at each other.&nbsp; One or two of the 
clan went to raise Hunter, and get him to fight, but it was no 
go; though he was not killed, he had had enough for that 
evening.&nbsp; Oh, I wish you had seen my customers; those who 
did not belong to the clan, but had taken part with them, and 
helped to jeer and flout me, now came and shook me by the hand, 
wishing me joy, and saying as how &lsquo;I was a brave fellow, 
and had served the bully right!&rsquo;&nbsp; As for the clan, 
they all said Hunter was bound to do me justice; so they made him
pay me what he owed for himself, and the reckoning of those among
them who said they had no money.&nbsp; Two or three of them then 
led him away, while the rest stayed behind, and flattered me, and
worshipped me, and called Hunter all kinds of dogs&rsquo; 
names.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it makes good what I read in
a letter which I received yesterday.&nbsp; It is just the way of 
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, that a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all; let me go on.&nbsp; Good
fortune never yet came alone.&nbsp; In about an hour comes home 
my poor niece, almost in high sterricks with joy, smiling and 
sobbing.&nbsp; She had been to the clergyman of M. . ., the great
preacher, to whose church she was in the habit of going, and to 
whose daughters she was well known; and to him she told a 
lamentable tale about my distresses, and about the snares which 
had been laid for my soul; and so well did she plead my cause, 
and so strong did the young ladies back all she said, that the 
good clergyman promised to stand my friend, and to lend me 
sufficient money to satisfy the brewer, and to get my soul out of
the snares of the man in black; and sure enough the next morning 
the two young ladies brought me the fifty pounds, which I 
forthwith carried to the brewer, who was monstrously civil, 
saying that he hoped any little understanding we had had would 
not prevent our being good friends in future.&nbsp; That <!-- 
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
108</span>a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all; the people of the neighbouring 
country hearing as if by art witchcraft that I had licked Hunter,
and was on good terms with the brewer, forthwith began to come in
crowds to look at me, pay me homage, and be my customers.&nbsp; 
Moreover, fifty scoundrels who owed me money, and who would have 
seen me starve rather than help me as long as they considered me 
a down pin, remembered their debts, and came and paid me more 
than they owed.&nbsp; That a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all: the brewer, 
being about to establish a stage-coach and three, to run across 
the country, says it shall stop and change horses at my house, 
and the passengers breakfast and sup as it goes and 
returns.&nbsp; He wishes me&mdash;whom he calls the best man in 
England&mdash;to give his son lessons in boxing, which he says he
considers a fine manly English art, and a great defence against 
Popery&mdash;notwithstanding that only a month ago, when he 
considered me a down pin, he was in the habit of railing against 
it as a blackguard practice, and against me as a blackguard for 
following it: so I am going to commence with young hopeful 
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot help congratulating you on your good 
fortune,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said the 
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;This very morning the folks of our parish 
made me churchwarden, which they would no more have done a month 
ago, when they considered me a down pin, than they . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if fortune pours 
in upon you in this manner, who knows but that within a year they
may make you justice of the peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, indeed!&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, I will prove myself worthy of my good luck by 
showing the grateful mind&mdash;not to those who would be kind to
me now, but to those who were, when the days were rather 
gloomy.&nbsp; My customers shall have abundance of rough 
language, but I&rsquo;ll knock any one down who says anything 
against the clergyman who lent me the fifty pounds, or against 
the Church of England, of which he is parson and I am 
churchwarden.&nbsp; I am also ready to do anything in reason for 
him who paid me for the ale he drank, when I shouldn&rsquo;t have
had the heart to collar him for the money had he refused to pay; 
who never jeered or flouted me like the rest of my customers when
I was a down pin&mdash;and though he refused to fight cross 
<i>for</i> me, was never cross <i>with</i> me, but listened to 
all I had to say, and gave me all kinds of good advice.&nbsp; Now
who do you think I mean <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>by this 
last? why, who but yourself&mdash;who on earth but 
yourself?&nbsp; The parson is a good man and a great preacher, 
and I&rsquo;ll knock anybody down who says to the contrary; and I
mention him first, because why? he&rsquo;s a gentleman, and you a
tinker.&nbsp; But I am by no means sure you are not the best 
friend of the two; for I doubt, do you see, whether I should have
had the fifty pounds but for you.&nbsp; You persuaded me to give 
up that silly drink they call sherry, and drink ale; and what was
it but drinking ale which gave me courage to knock down that 
fellow Hunter&mdash;and knocking him down was, I verily believe, 
the turning point of my disorder.&nbsp; God don&rsquo;t love 
those who won&rsquo;t strike out for themselves; and as far as I 
can calculate with respect to time, it was just the moment after 
I had knocked down Hunter, that the parson consented to lend me 
the money, and everything began to grow civil to me.&nbsp; So, 
dash my buttons if I show the ungrateful mind to you!&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t offer to knock anybody down for you, because 
why&mdash;I dare say you can knock a body down yourself; but 
I&rsquo;ll offer something more to the purpose.&nbsp; As my 
business is wonderfully on the increase, I shall want somebody to
help me in serving my customers, and keeping them in order.&nbsp;
If you choose to come and serve for your board, and what 
they&rsquo;ll give you, give me your fist; or if you like ten 
shillings a week better than their sixpences and ha&rsquo;pence, 
only say so&mdash;though, to be open with you, I believe you 
would make twice ten shillings out of them&mdash;the sneaking, 
fawning, curry-favouring humbugs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for 
your handsome offer, which, however, I am obliged to 
decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not fit for service,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;moreover, I am about to leave this part of the 
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I spoke, a horse neighed in the 
stable.&nbsp; &ldquo;What horse is that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to a cousin of mine, who put it into my 
hands yesterday, in hopes that I might get rid of it for him, 
though he would no more have done so a week ago, when he 
considered me a down pin, than he would have given the horse 
away.&nbsp; Are you fond of horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come and look at it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He led me into 
the stable, where, in a stall, stood a noble-looking animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I saw this horse at . . 
. fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;he was 
there, and was <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>offered for seventy pounds, but 
didn&rsquo;t find a bidder at any price.&nbsp; What do you think 
of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a splendid creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no judge of horses,&rdquo; said the landlord; 
&ldquo;but I am told he&rsquo;s a first-rate trotter, good 
leaper, and has some of the blood of Syntax.&nbsp; What does all 
that signify?&mdash;the game is against his master, who is a down
pin, is thinking of emigrating, and wants money 
confoundedly.&nbsp; He asked seventy pounds at the fair; but, 
between ourselves, he would be glad to take fifty 
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I were a rich
squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would buy him then,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
Here he mused for some time, with a very profound look.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It would be a rum thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if, some 
time or other, that horse should come into your hands.&nbsp; 
Didn&rsquo;t you hear how he neighed when you talked about 
leaving the country.&nbsp; My granny was a wise woman, and was up
to all kind of signs and wonders, sounds and noises, the 
interpretation of the language of birds and animals, crowing and 
lowing, neighing and braying.&nbsp; If she had been here, she 
would have said at once that that horse was fated to carry you 
away.&nbsp; On that point, however, I can say nothing, for under 
fifty pounds no one can have him.&nbsp; Are you taking that money
out of your pocket to pay me for the ale?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t 
do; nothing to pay; I invited you this time.&nbsp; Now if you are
going, you had best get into the road through the 
yard-gate.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t trouble you to make your way 
through the kitchen and my fine-weather company&mdash;confound 
them!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p>MR. PETULENGRO&rsquo;S DEVICE&mdash;THE LEATHERN 
PURSE&mdash;CONSENT TO PURCHASE A HORSE.</p>
<p>As I returned along the road I met Mr. Petulengro and one of 
his companions, who told me that they were bound for the 
public-house; whereupon I informed Jasper how I had seen in the 
stable the horse which we had admired at the fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you buy that horse after all, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; With a smile at the 
absurdity of such a supposition, I left him and his companion, 
and betook myself <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>to the dingle.&nbsp; In the evening 
I received a visit from Mr. Petulengro, who forthwith commenced 
talking about the horse, which he had again seen, the landlord 
having shown it to him on learning that he was a friend of 
mine.&nbsp; He told me that the horse pleased him more than ever,
he having examined his points with more accuracy than he had an 
opportunity of doing on the first occasion, concluding by 
pressing me to buy him.&nbsp; I begged him to desist from such 
foolish importunity, assuring him that I had never so much money 
in all my life as would enable me to purchase the horse.&nbsp; 
Whilst this discourse was going on, Mr. Petulengro and myself 
were standing together in the midst of the dingle.&nbsp; Suddenly
he began to move round me in a very singular manner, making 
strange motions with his hands, and frightful contortions with 
his features, till I became alarmed, and asked him whether he had
not lost his senses?&nbsp; Whereupon, ceasing his movements and 
contortions, he assured me that he had not, but had merely been 
seized with a slight dizziness, and then once more returned to 
the subject of the horse.&nbsp; Feeling myself very angry, I told
him that if he continued persecuting me in this manner, I should 
be obliged to quarrel with him; adding, that I believed his only 
motive for asking me to buy the animal was to insult my 
poverty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty poverty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with
fifty pounds in your pocket; however, I have heard say that it is
always the custom of your rich people to talk of their poverty, 
more especially when they wish to avoid laying out 
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surprised at his saying that I had fifty 
pounds in my pocket, I asked him what he meant; whereupon he told
me that he was very sure that I had fifty pounds in my pocket, 
offering to lay me five shillings to that effect.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have scarcely more than the 
fifth part of what you say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know better, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;and if you only pull 
out what you have in the pocket of your slop, I am sure you will 
have lost your wager.&rdquo;&nbsp; Putting my hand into the 
pocket, I felt something which I had never felt there before, and
pulling it out, perceived that it was a clumsy leathern purse, 
which I found on opening contained four ten-pound notes and 
several pieces of gold.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so, 
brother?&rdquo; said Mr Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, in the 
first place, please to pay me the five shillings you have 
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is only a foolish piece of 
pleasantry,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you put it into my pocket 
whilst you were moving about me, making faces like a distracted 
person.&nbsp; Here <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>take your purse back.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;not I, indeed! 
don&rsquo;t think I am such a fool.&nbsp; I have won my wager, so
pay me the five shillings, brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do drop 
this folly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and take your purse;&rdquo; and
I flung it on the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro, &ldquo;you were talking of quarrelling with me just 
now.&nbsp; I tell you now one thing, which is, that if you do not
take back the purse, I will quarrel with you; and it shall be for
good and all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drop your acquaintance, no longer 
call you my pal, and not even say sarshan to you when I meet you 
by the road-side.&nbsp; Hir mi diblis I never will.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
I saw by Jasper&rsquo;s look and tone that he was in earnest, 
and, as I had really a regard for the strange being, I scarcely 
knew what to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, be persuaded, brother,&rdquo; 
said Mr. Petulengro, taking up the purse and handing it to me; 
&ldquo;be persuaded; put the purse into your pocket, and buy the 
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I did 
so, would you acknowledge the horse to be yours, and receive the 
money again as soon as I should be able to repay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, brother, I would,&rdquo; said he; 
&ldquo;return me the money as soon as you please, provided you 
buy the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What motive have you for 
wishing me to buy that horse?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be sold for fifty pounds,&rdquo; said 
Jasper, &ldquo;and is worth four times that sum; though, like 
many a splendid bargain, he is now going a begging; buy him, and 
I&rsquo;m confident that in a little time a grand gentleman of 
your appearance may have anything he asks for him, and found a 
fortune by his means.&nbsp; Moreover, brother, I want to dispose 
of this fifty pounds in a safe manner.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t 
take it, I shall fool it away in no time, perhaps at 
card-playing, for you saw how I was cheated by those blackguard 
jockeys the other day&mdash;we gyptians don&rsquo;t know how to 
take care of money: our best plan when we have got a handful of 
guineas is to make buttons with them; but I have plenty of golden
buttons, and don&rsquo;t wish to be troubled with more, so you 
can do me no greater favour than vesting the money in this 
speculation, by which my mind will be relieved of considerable 
care and trouble for some time at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving that I still hesitated, he said, &ldquo;Perhaps, 
brother, you think that I did not come honestly by the money: by 
the honestest manner in the world, brother, for it is the money I
earned by fighting in the ring: I did not steal it, brother, nor 
did I get it by disposing of spavined donkeys, or glandered <!-- 
page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
113</span>ponies&mdash;nor is it, brother, the profits of my 
wife&rsquo;s witchcraft and dukkerin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you had better employ it in 
your traffic.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have plenty of money for my 
traffic, independent of this capital,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;ay, brother, and enough besides to back the husband of my 
wife&rsquo;s sister, Sylvester, against Slammocks of the Chong 
gav for twenty pounds, which I am thinking of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;after all, the horse may 
have found another purchaser by this time.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;there is nobody
in this neighbourhood to purchase a horse like that, unless it be
your lordship&mdash;so take the money, brother,&rdquo; and he 
thrust the purse into my hand.&nbsp; Allowing myself to be 
persuaded, I kept possession of the purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you 
satisfied now?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;you will please to 
pay me the five shillings which you lost to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the fifty pounds which I found 
in my pocket were not mine, but put in by yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with the matter, 
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;I betted you five 
shillings that you had fifty pounds in your pocket, which sum you
had: I did not say that they were your own, but merely that you 
had fifty pounds; you will therefore pay me, brother, or I shall 
not consider you an honourable man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to 
have any dispute about such a matter, I took five shillings out 
of my under pocket and gave them to him.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro 
took the money with great glee, observing&mdash;&ldquo;These five
shillings I will take to the public-house forthwith, and spend in
drinking with four of my brethren, and doing so will give me an 
opportunity of telling the landlord that I have found a customer 
for his horse, and that you are the man.&nbsp; It will be as well
to secure the horse as soon as possible; for though the dook 
tells me that the horse is intended for you, I have now and then 
found that the dook is, like myself, somewhat given to 
lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then departed, and I remained alone in the dingle.&nbsp; I 
thought at first that I had committed a great piece of folly in 
consenting to purchase this horse; I might find no desirable 
purchaser for him until the money in my possession should be 
totally exhausted, and then I might be compelled to sell him for 
half the price I had given for him, or be even glad to find a 
person who would receive him at a gift; I should then <!-- page 
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
114</span>remain sans horse, and indebted to Mr. 
Petulengro.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was possible that I might sell
the horse very advantageously, and by so doing, obtain a fund 
sufficient to enable me to execute some grand enterprise or 
other.&nbsp; My present way of life afforded no prospect of 
support, whereas the purchase of the horse did afford a 
possibility of bettering my condition, so, after all, had I not 
done right in consenting to purchase the horse?&nbsp; The 
purchase was to be made with another person&rsquo;s property it 
is true, and I did not exactly like the idea of speculating with 
another person&rsquo;s property, but Mr. Petulengro had thrust 
his money upon me, and if I lost his money, he could have no one 
but himself to blame; so I persuaded myself that I had upon the 
whole done right, and having come to that persuasion I soon began
to enjoy the idea of finding myself on horseback again, and 
figured to myself all kinds of strange adventures which I should 
meet with on the roads before the horse and I should part 
company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p>TRYING THE HORSE&mdash;THE FEATS OF TAWNO&mdash;MAN WITH THE 
RED WAISTCOAT&mdash;DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY.</p>
<p>I saw nothing more of Mr. Petulengro that evening&mdash;on the
morrow, however, he came and informed me that he had secured the 
horse for me, and that I was to go and pay for it at noon.&nbsp; 
At the hour appointed, therefore, I went with Mr. Petulengro and 
Tawno to the public, where, as before, there was a crowd of 
company.&nbsp; The landlord received us in the bar with marks of 
much satisfaction and esteem, made us sit down, and treated us 
with some excellent mild draught ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do you 
think has been here this morning?&rdquo; he said to me, 
&ldquo;why that fellow in black, who came to carry me off to a 
house of Popish devotion, where I was to pass seven days and 
nights in meditation, as I think he called it, before I publicly 
renounced the religion of my country.&nbsp; I read him a pretty 
lecture, calling him several unhandsome names, and asking him 
what he meant by attempting to seduce a churchwarden of the 
Church of England.&nbsp; I tell you what, he ran some danger; for
some of my customers, learning his errand, <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>laid hold 
on him, and were about to toss him in a blanket, and then duck 
him in the horse-pond.&nbsp; I, however, interfered, and said 
&lsquo;that what he came about was between me and him, and that 
it was no business of theirs.&rsquo;&nbsp; To tell you the truth,
I felt pity for the poor devil, more especially when I considered
that they merely sided against him because they thought him the 
weakest, and that they would have wanted to serve me in the same 
manner had they considered me a down pin; so I rescued him from 
their hands, told him not to be afraid, for that nobody should 
touch him, and offered to treat him to some cold gin and water 
with a lump of sugar in it; and, on his refusing, told him that 
he had better make himself scarce, which he did, and I hope I 
shall never see him again.&nbsp; So I suppose you are come for 
the horse; mercy upon us! who would have thought you would have 
become the purchaser?&nbsp; The horse, however, seemed to know it
by his neighing.&nbsp; How did you ever come by the money? 
however, that&rsquo;s no matter of mine.&nbsp; I suppose you are 
strongly backed by certain friends you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I informed the landlord that he was right in supposing that I 
came for the horse, but that, before I paid for him, I should 
wish to prove his capabilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my 
heart,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall mount him
this moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then going into the stable he saddled 
and bridled the horse, and presently brought him out before the 
door.&nbsp; I mounted him, Mr. Petulengro putting a heavy whip 
into my hand, and saying a few words to me in his own mysterious 
language.&nbsp; &ldquo;The horse wants no whip,&rdquo; said the 
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue, daddy,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;My pal knows quite well what to do with 
the whip, he&rsquo;s not going to beat the horse with 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; About four hundred yards from the house there 
was a hill, to the foot of which the road ran almost on a perfect
level; towards the foot of this hill I trotted the horse, who set
off at a long, swift pace, seemingly at the rate of about sixteen
miles an hour.&nbsp; On reaching the foot of the hill, I wheeled 
the animal round, and trotted him towards the house&mdash;the 
horse sped faster than before.&nbsp; Ere he had advanced a 
hundred yards, I took off my hat, in obedience to the advice 
which Mr. Petulengro had given me in his own language, and 
holding it over the horse&rsquo;s head, commenced drumming on the
crown with the knob of the whip; the horse gave a slight start, 
but instantly recovering himself, continued his trot till <!-- 
page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
116</span>he arrived at the door of the public-house, amidst the 
acclamations of the company, who had all rushed out of the house 
to be spectators of what was going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see now 
what you wanted the whip for,&rdquo; said the landlord, 
&ldquo;and sure enough, that drumming on your hat was no bad way 
of learning whether the horse was quiet or not.&nbsp; Well, did 
you ever see a more quiet horse, or a better 
trotter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My cob shall trot against 
him,&rdquo; said a fellow dressed in velveteen, mounted on a low 
powerful-looking animal.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cob shall trot against 
him to the hill and back again&mdash;come on!&rdquo;&nbsp; We 
both started; the cob kept up gallantly against the horse for 
about half the way to the hill, when he began to lose ground; at 
the foot of the hill he was about fifteen yards behind.&nbsp; 
Whereupon, I turned slowly and waited for him.&nbsp; We then set 
off towards the house, but now the cob had no chance, being at 
least twenty yards behind when I reached the door.&nbsp; This 
running of horses, the wild uncouth forms around me, and the ale 
and beer which were being guzzled from pots and flagons, put me 
wonderfully in mind of the ancient horse-races of the heathen 
north.&nbsp; I almost imagined myself Gunnar of Hlitharend at the
race of . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that he could leap?&rdquo; I 
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am told he can,&rdquo; said the 
landlord; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t consent that he should be 
tried in that way, as he might be damaged.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, 
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t trust my pal to leap that horse, he&rsquo;ll 
merely fling him down, and break his neck and his own.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s a better man than he close by; let him get on his 
back and leap him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean yourself, I 
suppose,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call that
talking modestly, and nothing becomes a young man more than 
modesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I, 
daddy,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the 
man,&rdquo; said he, pointing to Tawno.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the horse-leaper of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean the 
horseback breaker,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;That 
big fellow would break down my cousin&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, he weighs only sixteen stone,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his sixteen stone, with his way of 
handling a horse, does not press so much as any other one&rsquo;s
thirteen.&nbsp; Only let him get on the horse&rsquo;s back, and 
you&rsquo;ll see what he can do!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; 
said the landlord, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Whereupon Mr. Petulengro became very much excited; and pulling 
out a handful of money, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, 
I&rsquo;ll forfeit these guineas if <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>my black 
pal there does the horse any kind of damage; duck me in the 
horse-pond if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said the landlord &ldquo;for the sport of the thing I consent, so
let your white pal get down and your black pal mount as soon as 
he pleases.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt rather mortified at Mr. 
Petulengro&rsquo;s interference; and showed no disposition to 
quit my seat; whereupon he came up to me and said, &ldquo;Now, 
brother, do get out of the saddle&mdash;you are no bad hand at 
trotting, I am willing to acknowledge that; but at leaping a 
horse there is no one like Tawno.&nbsp; Let every dog be praised 
for his own gift.&nbsp; You have been showing off in your line 
for the last half-hour; now do give Tawno a chance of exhibiting 
a little; poor fellow, he hasn&rsquo;t often a chance of 
exhibiting, as his wife keeps him so much in sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Not wishing to appear desirous of engrossing the public 
attention, and feeling rather desirous to see how Tawno, of whose
exploits in leaping horses I had frequently heard, would acquit 
himself in the affair, I at length dismounted, and Tawno, at a 
bound, leaped into the saddle, where he really looked like Gunnar
of Hlitharend, save and except that the complexion of Gunnar was 
florid, whereas that of Tawno was of nearly Mulatto darkness; and
that all Tawno&rsquo;s features were cast in the Grecian model, 
whereas Gunnar had a snub nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a 
leaping-bar behind the house,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Leaping-bar!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, scornfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think my black pal ever rides at a 
leaping-bar?&nbsp; No more than at a windle-straw.&nbsp; Leap 
over that meadow wall, Tawno.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just past the house, 
in the direction in which I had been trotting, was a wall about 
four feet high, beyond which was a small meadow.&nbsp; Tawno rode
the horse gently up to the wall, permitted him to look over, then
backed him for about ten yards, and pressing his calves against 
the horse&rsquo;s sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse 
launching forward, took the leap in gallant style.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well done, man and horse!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; 
&ldquo;now come back, Tawno.&rdquo;&nbsp; The leap from the side 
of the meadow was, however, somewhat higher; and the horse, when 
pushed at it, at first turned away; whereupon Tawno backed him to
a greater distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop, giving a 
wild cry; whereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly 
grazing one of his legs against it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A near 
thing,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;but a good leap.&nbsp; 
Now no more leaping, so long as I have control over the 
animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The horse was then led back to the stable; 
and the landlord, <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>myself, and companions going into 
the bar, I paid down the money for the horse.</p>
<p>Scarcely was the bargain concluded, when two or three of the 
company began to envy me the possession of the horse, and forcing
their way into the bar, with much noise and clamour, said that 
the horse had been sold too cheap.&nbsp; One fellow, in 
particular, with a red waistcoat, the son of a wealthy farmer, 
said that if he had but known that the horse had been so good a 
one, he would have bought it at the first price asked for it, 
which he was now willing to pay, that is to-morrow, 
supposing&mdash;&ldquo;supposing your father will let you have 
the money,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;which, after all, 
might not be the case; but, however that may be, it is too late 
now.&nbsp; I think myself the horse has been sold for too little 
money, but if so, all the better for the young man who came 
forward when no other body did with his money in his hand.&nbsp; 
There, take yourselves out of my bar,&rdquo; said he to the 
fellows; &ldquo;and a pretty scoundrel you,&rdquo; said he to the
man of the red waistcoat, &ldquo;to say the horse has been sold 
too cheap, why, it was only yesterday you said he was good for 
nothing, and were passing all kinds of jokes at him.&nbsp; Take 
yourself out of my bar, I say, you and all of you,&rdquo; and he 
turned the fellows out.&nbsp; I then asked the landlord whether 
he would permit the horse to remain in the stable for a short 
time, provided I paid for his entertainment; and on his willingly
consenting, I treated my friends with ale, and then returned with
them to the encampment.</p>
<p>That evening I informed Mr. Petulengro and his party that on 
the morrow I intended to mount my horse and leave that part of 
the country in quest of adventures; inquiring of Jasper where, in
the event of my selling the horse advantageously, I might meet 
with him, and repay the money I had borrowed of him; whereupon 
Mr. Petulengro informed me that in about ten weeks I might find 
him at a certain place at the Chong gav.&nbsp; I then stated that
as I could not well carry with me the property which I possessed 
in the dingle, which after all was of no considerable value, I 
had resolved to bestow the said property, namely, the pony, tent,
tinker-tools, &amp;c., on Ursula and her husband, partly because 
they were poor, and partly on account of the great kindness which
I bore to Ursula, from whom I had, on various occasions, 
experienced all manner of civility, particularly in regard to 
crabbed words.&nbsp; On hearing this intelligence, Ursula 
returned many thanks to her <!-- page 119--><a 
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>gentle 
brother, as she called me, and Sylvester was so overjoyed that 
casting aside his usual phlegm, he said I was the best friend he 
had ever had in the world, and in testimony of his gratitude 
swore that he would permit me to give his wife a choomer in the 
presence of the whole company, which offer, however, met with a 
very mortifying reception; the company frowning disapprobation, 
Ursula protesting against anything of the kind, and I myself 
showing no forwardness to avail myself of it, having inherited 
from nature a considerable fund of modesty, to which was added no
slight store acquired in the course of my Irish education.&nbsp; 
I passed that night alone in the dingle in a very melancholy 
manner, with little or no sleep, thinking of Isopel Berners; and 
in the morning when I quitted it I shed several tears, as I 
reflected that I should probably never again see the spot where I
had passed so many hours in her company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p>FAREWELL TO THE ROMANS&mdash;THE LANDLORD AND HIS 
NIECE&mdash;SET OUT AS A TRAVELLER.</p>
<p>On reaching the plain above, I found my Romany friends 
breakfasting, and on being asked by Mr. Petulengro to join them, 
I accepted the invitation.&nbsp; No sooner was breakfast over 
than I informed Ursula and her husband that they would find the 
property which I had promised them below in the dingle, 
commending the little pony Ambrol to their best care.&nbsp; I 
took leave of the whole company, which was itself about to break 
up camp and to depart in the direction of London, and made the 
best of my way to the public-house.&nbsp; I had a small bundle in
my hand, and was dressed in the same manner as when I departed 
from London, having left my waggoner&rsquo;s slop with the other 
effects in the dingle.&nbsp; On arriving at the public-house, I 
informed the landlord that I was come for my horse, inquiring at 
the same time whether he could not accommodate me with a bridle 
and saddle.&nbsp; He told me that the bridle and saddle with 
which I had ridden the horse on the preceding day were at my 
service for a trifle; that he had received them some time since 
in payment for a debt, and that he had himself no use for 
them.&nbsp; The leathers of the bridle were rather shabby, and 
the bit rusty, and the saddle was old-fashioned; but I was happy 
to purchase them <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>for seven shillings, more especially
as the landlord added a small valise, which he said could be 
strapped to the saddle, and which I should find very convenient 
for carrying my things in.&nbsp; I then proceeded to the stable, 
told the horse we were bound on an expedition, and giving him a 
feed of corn, left him to discuss it, and returned to the 
bar-room to have a little farewell chat with the landlord, and at
the same time to drink with him a farewell glass of ale.&nbsp; 
Whilst we were talking and drinking, the niece came and joined 
us: she was a decent, sensible, young woman, who appeared to take
a great interest in her uncle, whom she regarded with a singular 
mixture of pride and disapprobation&mdash;pride for the renown 
which he had acquired by his feats of old, and disapprobation for
his late imprudences.&nbsp; She said that she hoped that his 
misfortunes would be a warning to him to turn more to his God 
than he had hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and other
low-life practices.&nbsp; To which the landlord replied, that 
with respect to cock-fighting he intended to give it up entirely,
being determined no longer to risk his capital upon birds, and 
with respect to his religious duties he should attend the church 
of which he was churchwarden at least once a quarter, adding, 
however, that he did not intend to become either canter or 
driveller, neither of which characters would befit a publican 
surrounded by such customers as he was, and that to the last day 
of his life he hoped to be able to make use of his fists.&nbsp; 
After a stay of about two hours I settled accounts; and having 
bridled and saddled my horse, and strapped on the valise, I 
mounted, shook hands with the landlord and his niece, and 
departed, notwithstanding that they both entreated me to tarry 
until the evening, it being then the heat of the day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p>AN ADVENTURE ON THE ROADS&mdash;THE SIX FLINT STONES&mdash;A 
RURAL SCENE&mdash;MEAD&mdash;THE OLD MAN AND HIS BEES.</p>
<p>I bent my course in the direction of the north, more induced 
by chance than any particular motive; all quarters of the world 
having about equal attractions for me.&nbsp; I was in high 
spirits at finding myself once more on horseback, and trotted 
gaily on, <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>until the heat of the weather 
induced me to slacken my pace, more out of pity for my horse than
because I felt any particular inconvenience from it&mdash;heat 
and cold being then, and still, matters of great indifference to 
me.&nbsp; What I thought of I scarcely know, save and except that
I have a glimmering recollection that I felt some desire to meet 
with one of those adventures which upon the roads of England are 
generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn; and Fortune, 
who has generally been ready to gratify my inclinations, provided
it cost her very little by so doing, was not slow in furnishing 
me with an adventure, perhaps as characteristic of the English 
roads as anything which could have happened.</p>
<p>I might have travelled about six miles, amongst cross-roads 
and lanes, when suddenly I found myself upon a broad and very 
dusty road, which seemed to lead due north.&nbsp; As I wended 
along this, I saw a man upon a donkey, riding towards me.&nbsp; 
The man was commonly dressed, with a broad felt hat on his head, 
and a kind of satchel on his back; he seemed to be in a mighty 
hurry, and was every now and then belabouring the donkey with a 
cudgel.&nbsp; The donkey, however, which was a fine large 
creature of the silver-grey species, did not appear to sympathise
at all with its rider in his desire to get on, but kept its head 
turned back as much as possible, moving from one side of the road
to the other, and not making much forward way.&nbsp; As I passed,
being naturally of a very polite disposition, I gave the man the 
sele of the day, asking him at the same time why he beat the 
donkey; whereupon the fellow, eyeing me askance, told me to mind 
my own business, with the addition of something which I need not 
repeat.&nbsp; I had not proceeded a furlong before I saw seated 
on the dust by the wayside, close by a heap of stones, and with 
several flints before him, a respectable-looking old man, with a 
straw hat and a white smock, who was weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you crying for, father?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Have you come to any hurt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurt 
enough,&rdquo; sobbed the old man; &ldquo;I have been just 
tricked out of the best ass in England by a villain who gave me 
nothing but these trash in return,&rdquo; pointing to the stones 
before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really scarcely understand you,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I wish you would explain yourself more 
clearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was riding on my ass from 
market,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;when I met here a fellow 
with a sack on his back, who, after staring at the ass and me a 
moment or two, asked me if I would sell her.&nbsp; I <!-- page 
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>told him that I could not think of selling her, as she 
was very useful to me, and though an animal, my true companion, 
whom I loved as much as if she were my wife and daughter.&nbsp; I
then attempted to pass on, but the fellow stood before me, 
begging me to sell her, saying that he would give me anything for
her; well, seeing that he persisted, I said at last that if I 
sold her, I must have six pounds for her, and I said so to get 
rid of him, for I saw that he was a shabby fellow, who had 
probably not six shillings in the world; but I had better have 
held my tongue,&rdquo; said the old man, crying more bitterly 
than before, &ldquo;for the words were scarcely out of my mouth, 
when he said he would give me what I asked, and taking the sack 
from his back, he pulled out a steelyard, and going to the heap 
of stones there, he took up several of them and weighed them, 
then flinging them down before me, he said, &lsquo;There are six 
pounds, neighbour; now, get off the ass, and hand her over to 
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, I sat like one dumbfoundered for a time, 
till at last I asked him what he meant?&nbsp; &lsquo;What do I 
mean,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you old rascal, why, I mean to claim
my purchase,&rsquo; and then he swore so awfully, that scarcely 
knowing what I did I got down, and he jumped on the animal and 
rode off as fast as he could.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose he 
was the fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whom I just now met upon a 
fine grey ass, which he was beating with a cudgel.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I daresay he was,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I saw 
him beating her as he rode away, and I thought I should have 
died.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never heard such a story,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;well, do you mean to submit to such a piece of roguery 
quietly?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said the old man, 
&ldquo;what can I do?&nbsp; I am seventy-nine years of age; I am 
bad on my feet, and dar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go after 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I go?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the 
fellow is a thief, and any one has a right to stop 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if you could but bring her again to 
me,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I would bless you to my dying
day; but have a care; I don&rsquo;t know but after all the law 
may say that she is his lawful purchase.&nbsp; I asked six pounds
for her, and he gave me six pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Six 
flints you mean,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;no, no, the law is not 
quite so bad as that either; I know something about her, and am 
sure that she will never sanction such a quibble.&nbsp; At all 
events, I&rsquo;ll ride after the fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon 
turning the horse round, I put him to his very best trot; I rode 
nearly a mile without obtaining a glimpse of the fellow, and was 
becoming apprehensive that he had escaped me by turning down some
by-path, two or three of which I had passed.&nbsp; Suddenly, 
however, on <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the road making a slight turning, I 
perceived him right before me, moving at a tolerably swift pace, 
having by this time probably overcome the resistance of the 
animal.&nbsp; Putting my horse to a full gallop, I shouted at the
top of my voice &ldquo;Get off that donkey, you rascal, and give 
her up to me, or I&rsquo;ll ride you down.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
fellow hearing the thunder of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs behind him,
drew up on one side of the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you 
want?&rdquo; said he, as I stopped my charger, now almost covered
with sweat and foam, close beside him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want 
to rob me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To rob you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No! but to take from you that ass, of which you have just 
robbed its owner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have robbed no 
man,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;I just now purchased it 
fairly of its master, and the law will give it to me; he asked 
six pounds for it, and I gave him six pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Six stones, you mean, you rascal,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;get down, or my horse shall be upon you in a 
moment;&rdquo; then with a motion of my reins, I caused the horse
to rear, pressing his sides with my heels as if I intended to 
make him leap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the man, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get down, and then try if I can&rsquo;t serve 
you out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then got down, and confronted me with 
his cudgel; he was a horrible-looking fellow, and seemed prepared
for anything.&nbsp; Scarcely, however, had he dismounted, when 
the donkey jerked the bridle out of his hand, and probably in 
revenge for the usage she had received, gave him a pair of 
tremendous kicks on the hip with her hinder legs, which 
overturned him, and then scampered down the road the way she had 
come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty treatment this,&rdquo; said the fellow,
getting up without his cudgel, and holding his hand to his side, 
&ldquo;I wish I may not be lamed for life.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And if you be,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it would merely serve
you right, you rascal, for trying to cheat a poor old man out of 
his property by quibbling at words.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Rascal!&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo;you lie, I am no 
rascal; and as for quibbling with words&mdash;suppose I 
did!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; All the first people does it!&nbsp; 
The newspapers does it!&nbsp; The gentlefolks that calls 
themselves the guides of the popular mind does it!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m no ignoramus.&nbsp; I reads the newspapers, and knows 
what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You read them to some 
purpose,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if you are lamed for 
life, and unfitted for any active line&mdash;turn newspaper 
editor; I should say you are perfectly qualified, and this 
day&rsquo;s adventure may be the foundation of your 
fortune;&rdquo; thereupon I turned round and rode off.&nbsp; The 
fellow followed me with a torrent of abuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound
you,&rdquo; <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>said he&mdash;yet that was not the 
expression either&mdash;&ldquo;I know you; you are one of the 
horse-patrol, come down into the country on leave to see your 
relations.&nbsp; Confound you, you and the like of you have 
knocked my business on the head near Lunnon, and I suppose we 
shall have you shortly in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To the
newspaper office,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and fabricate falsehoods 
out of flint stones;&rdquo; then touching the horse with my 
heels, I trotted off, and coming to the place where I had seen 
the old man, I found him there, risen from the ground, and 
embracing his ass.</p>
<p>I told him that I was travelling down the road, and said that 
if his way lay in the same direction as mine, he could do no 
better than accompany me for some distance, lest the fellow, who,
for aught I knew, might be hovering nigh, might catch him alone, 
and again get his ass from him.&nbsp; After thanking me for my 
offer, which he said he would accept, he got upon his ass, and we
proceeded together down the road.&nbsp; My new acquaintance said 
very little of his own accord; and when I asked him a question, 
answered rather incoherently.&nbsp; I heard him every now and 
then say, &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; to himself, after which he would
pat the donkey&rsquo;s neck, from which circumstance I concluded 
that his mind was occupied with his late adventure.&nbsp; After 
travelling about two miles, we reached a place where a drift-way 
on the right led from the great road; here my companion stopped, 
and on my asking him whether he was going any farther, he told me
that the path to the right was the way to his home.</p>
<p>I was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice, and 
said that as he did not live far off, he hoped that I would go 
with him and taste some of his mead.&nbsp; As I had never tasted 
mead, of which I had frequently read in the compositions of the 
Welsh bards, and, moreover, felt rather thirsty from the heat of 
the day, I told him that I should have great pleasure in 
attending him.&nbsp; Whereupon, turning off together, we 
proceeded about half a mile, sometimes between stone walls, and 
at other times hedges, till we reached a small hamlet, through 
which we passed, and presently came to a very pretty cottage, 
delightfully situated within a garden, surrounded by a hedge of 
woodbines.&nbsp; Opening a gate at one corner of the garden, he 
led the way to a large shed which stood partly behind the 
cottage, which he said was his stable; thereupon he dismounted 
and led his donkey into the shed, which was without <!-- page 
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
125</span>stalls, but had a long rack and manger.&nbsp; On one 
side he tied his donkey, after taking off her caparisons, and I 
followed his example, tying my horse at the other side with a 
rope halter which he gave me; he then asked me to come in and 
taste his mead, but I told him that I must attend to the comfort 
of my horse first, and forthwith, taking a wisp of straw, rubbed 
him carefully down.&nbsp; Then taking a pailful of clear water 
which stood in the shed, I allowed the horse to drink about half 
a pint; and then turning to the old man, who all the time had 
stood by looking at my proceedings, I asked him whether he had 
any oats?&nbsp; &ldquo;I have all kinds of grain,&rdquo; he 
replied; and, going out, he presently returned with two measures,
one a large and the other a small one, both filled with oats, 
mixed with a few beans, and handing the large one to me for the 
horse, he emptied the other before the donkey, who, before she 
began to despatch it, turned her nose to her master&rsquo;s face 
and fairly kissed him.&nbsp; Having given my horse his portion, I
told the old man that I was ready to taste his mead as soon as he
pleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage, where, making 
me sit down by a deal table in a neatly-sanded kitchen, he 
produced from an old-fashioned closet a bottle, holding about a 
quart, and a couple of cups, which might each contain about half 
a pint, then opening the bottle and filling the cups with a 
brown-coloured liquor, he handed one to me, and taking a seat 
opposite to me, he lifted the other, nodded, and saying to 
me&mdash;&ldquo;Health and welcome,&rdquo; placed it to his lips 
and drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Health and thanks,&rdquo; I replied; and being very 
thirsty, emptied my cup at a draught; I had scarcely done so, 
however, when I half repented.&nbsp; The mead was deliciously 
sweet and mellow, but appeared strong as brandy; my eyes reeled 
in my head, and my brain became slightly dizzy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mead
is a strong drink,&rdquo; said the old man, as he looked at me, 
with a half smile on his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is, at 
any rate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so strong, indeed, that I would 
not drink another cup for any consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And I would not ask you,&rdquo; said the old man; 
&ldquo;for, if you did, you would most probably be stupid all 
day, and wake next morning with a headache.&nbsp; Mead is a good 
drink, but woundily strong, especially to those who be not used 
to it, as I suppose you are not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you
get it?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I make it myself,&rdquo; said
the old man, &ldquo;from the honey which my bees 
make.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you many bees?&rdquo; I 
inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great many,&rdquo; said the old 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>keep 
them,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the sake of making mead with 
their honey?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I keep them,&rdquo; he replied, 
&ldquo;partly because I am fond of them, and partly for what they
bring me in; they make me a great deal of honey, some of which I 
sell, and with a little I make me some mead to warm my poor heart
with, or occasionally to treat a friend with like 
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you support yourself 
entirely by means of your bees?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; 
said the old man; &ldquo;I have a little bit of ground behind my 
house, which is my principal means of support.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And do you live alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; 
said he; &ldquo;with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I 
live quite alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And have you always lived 
alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man emptied his cup, and his heart 
being warmed with the mead, he told me his history, which was 
simplicity itself.&nbsp; His father was a small yeoman, who, at 
his death, had left him, his only child, the cottage, with a 
small piece of ground behind it, and on this little property he 
had lived ever since.&nbsp; About the age of twenty-five he had 
married an industrious young woman, by whom he had one daughter, 
who died before reaching years of womanhood.&nbsp; His wife, 
however, had survived her daughter many years, and had been a 
great comfort to him, assisting him in his rural occupations; 
but, about four years before the present period, he had lost her,
since which time he had lived alone, making himself as 
comfortable as he could; cultivating his ground, with the help of
a lad from the neighbouring village, attending to his bees, and 
occasionally riding his donkey to market, and hearing the word of
God, which he said he was sorry he could not read, twice a week 
regularly at the parish church.&nbsp; Such was the old 
man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house, and
showed me his little domain.&nbsp; It consisted of about two 
acres in admirable cultivation; a small portion of it formed a 
kitchen garden, while the rest was sown with four kinds of grain,
wheat, barley, pease, and beans.&nbsp; The air was full of 
ambrosial sweets, resembling those proceeding from an orange 
grove; a place, which though I had never seen at that time, I 
since have.&nbsp; In the garden was the habitation of the bees, a
long box, supported upon three oaken stumps.&nbsp; It was full of
small round glass windows, and appeared to be divided into a 
great many compartments, much resembling drawers placed 
sideways.&nbsp; He told me that, as one compartment was filled, 
the bees left it for another; so that, whenever he wanted honey, 
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>he could procure some without injuring the 
insects.&nbsp; Through the little round windows I could see 
several of the bees at work; hundreds were going in and out of 
the doors; hundreds were buzzing about on the flowers, the 
woodbines, and beans.&nbsp; As I looked around on the 
well-cultivated field, the garden, and the bees, I thought I had 
never before seen so rural and peaceful a scene.</p>
<p>When we returned to the cottage we again sat down, and I asked
the old man whether he was not afraid to live alone.&nbsp; He 
told me that he was not, for that, upon the whole, his neighbours
were very kind to him.&nbsp; I mentioned the fellow who had 
swindled him of his donkey upon the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was 
no neighbour of mine,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and perhaps
I shall never see him again, or his like.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to have
no other resource, when injured, than to shed tears on the 
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said the old man; 
&ldquo;but God saw the tears of the old, and sent a 
helper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not help yourself?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead of getting off your ass, why did you
not punch at the fellow, or at any rate use dreadful language, 
call him villain, and shout robbery?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Punch!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;shout! what, with 
these hands, and this voice&mdash;Lord, how you run on!&nbsp; I 
am old, young chap, I am old!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;it is a shameful thing to cry even when 
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You think so now,&rdquo; said the old 
man, &ldquo;because you are young and strong; perhaps when you 
are as old as I, you will not be ashamed to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the whole I was rather pleased with the old man, and much
with all about him.&nbsp; As evening drew nigh, I told him that I
must proceed on my journey; whereupon he invited me to tarry with
him during the night, telling me that he had a nice room and bed 
above at my service.&nbsp; I, however, declined; and bidding him 
farewell, mounted my horse, and departed.&nbsp; Regaining the 
road, I proceeded once more in the direction of the north; and, 
after a few hours, coming to a comfortable public house, I 
stopped and put up for the night.</p>

<p>THE SINGULAR NOISE&mdash;SLEEPING IN A MEADOW&mdash;THE 
BOOK&mdash;CURE FOR WAKEFULNESS&mdash;LITERARY TEA 
PARTY&mdash;POOR BYRON.</p>
<p>I did not wake till rather late the next morning; and when I 
did, I felt considerable drowsiness, with a slight headache, 
which I was uncharitable enough to attribute to the mead which I 
had drank on the preceding day.&nbsp; After feeding my horse, and
breakfasting, I proceeded on my wanderings.&nbsp; Nothing 
occurred worthy of relating till midday was considerably past, 
when I came to a pleasant valley, between two gentle hills.&nbsp;
I had dismounted, in order to ease my horse, and was leading him 
along by the bridle, when, on my right, behind a bank in which 
some umbrageous ashes were growing, I heard a singular 
noise.&nbsp; I stopped short and listened, and presently said to 
myself, &ldquo;Surely this is snoring, perhaps that of a 
hedgehog.&rdquo;&nbsp; On further consideration, however, I was 
convinced that the noise which I heard, and which certainly 
seemed to be snoring, could not possibly proceed from the 
nostrils of so small an animal, but must rather come from those 
of a giant, so loud and sonorous was it.&nbsp; About two or three
yards farther was a gate, partly open, to which I went, and 
peeping into the field, saw a man lying on some rich grass, under
the shade of one of the ashes; he was snoring away at a great 
rate.&nbsp; Impelled by curiosity, I fastened the bridle of my 
horse to the gate, and went up to the man.&nbsp; He was a 
genteelly-dressed individual; rather corpulent, with dark 
features, and seemingly about forty-five.&nbsp; He lay on his 
back, his hat slightly over his brow, and at his right hand lay 
an open book.&nbsp; So strenuously did he snore that the wind 
from his nostrils agitated, perceptibly, a fine cambric frill 
which he wore at his bosom.&nbsp; I gazed upon him for some time,
expecting that he might awake; but he did not, but kept on 
snoring, his breast heaving convulsively.&nbsp; At last, the 
noise he made became so terrible, that I felt alarmed for his 
safety, imagining that a fit might seize him, and he lose his 
life whilst asleep.&nbsp; I therefore exclaimed, &ldquo;Sir, sir,
awake! you sleep overmuch.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my voice failed to 
rouse him, and he continued snoring as before; whereupon I 
touched him slightly with my riding <!-- page 129--><a 
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>wand, but 
failing to wake him I touched him again more vigorously; 
whereupon he opened his eyes, and, probably imagining himself in 
a dream, closed them again.&nbsp; But I was determined to arouse 
him, and cried as loud as I could, &ldquo;Sir, sir, pray sleep no
more!&rdquo;&nbsp; He heard what I said, opened his eyes again, 
stared at me with a look of some consciousness, and, half raising
himself upon his elbows, asked me what was the matter.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I took the 
liberty of awaking you, because you appeared to be much disturbed
in your sleep&mdash;I was fearful, too, that you might catch a 
fever from sleeping under a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I run no 
risk,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I often come and sleep here; 
and as for being disturbed in my sleep, I felt very comfortable; 
I wish you had not awoken me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;I beg your pardon once more.&nbsp; I assure you 
that what I did was with the best intention.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh! pray make no further apology,&rdquo; said the 
individual, &ldquo;I make no doubt that what you did was done 
kindly; but there&rsquo;s an old proverb to the effect 
&lsquo;that you should let sleeping dogs lie,&rsquo;&rdquo; he 
added, with a smile.&nbsp; Then, getting up, and stretching 
himself with a yawn, he took up his book and said, &ldquo;I have 
slept quite long enough, and it&rsquo;s quite time for me to be 
going home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse my curiosity,&rdquo; said 
I, &ldquo;if I inquire what may induce you to come and sleep in 
this meadow?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; 
answered he, &ldquo;I am a bad sleeper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray 
pardon me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I tell you that I never saw 
one sleep more heartily.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I did so,&rdquo; 
said the individual, &ldquo;I am beholden to this meadow and this
book; but I am talking riddles, and will explain myself.&nbsp; I 
am the owner of a very pretty property, of which this valley 
forms part.&nbsp; Some years ago, however, up started a person 
who said the property was his; a lawsuit ensued, and I was on the
brink of losing my all, when, most unexpectedly, the suit was 
determined in my favour.&nbsp; Owing, however, to the anxiety to 
which my mind had been subjected for years, my nerves had become 
terribly shaken; and no sooner was the trial terminated than 
sleep forsook my pillow.&nbsp; I sometimes passed nights without 
closing an eye; I took opiates, but they rather increased than 
alleviated my malady.&nbsp; About three weeks ago a friend of 
mine put this book into my hand, and advised me to take it every 
day to some pleasant part of my estate, and try and read a page 
or two, assuring me, if I did, that I should infallibly fall 
asleep.&nbsp; I took his advice, and selecting this place, which 
I <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
130</span>considered the pleasantest part of my property, I came,
and lying down, commenced reading the book, and before finishing 
a page was in a dead slumber.&nbsp; Every day since then I have 
repeated the experiment, and every time with equal success.&nbsp;
I am a single man, without any children; and yesterday I made my 
will, in which, in the event of my friend&rsquo;s surviving me, I
have left him all my fortune, in gratitude for his having 
procured for me the most invaluable of all 
blessings&mdash;sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how very 
extraordinary!&nbsp; Do you think that your going to sleep is 
caused by the meadow or the book?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose 
by both,&rdquo; said my new acquaintance, &ldquo;acting in 
co-operation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;the magic influence does certainly not proceed from the 
meadow alone; for since I have been here, I have not felt the 
slightest inclination to sleep.&nbsp; Does the book consist of 
prose or poetry?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It consists of 
poetry,&rdquo; said the individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not 
Byron&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Byron&rsquo;s!&rdquo; 
repeated the individual, with a smile of contempt; &ldquo;no, no;
there is nothing narcotic in Byron&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I used to read it, but it thrilled, 
agitated, and kept me awake.&nbsp; No, this is not Byron&rsquo;s 
poetry, but the inimitable . . .&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;mentioning 
a name which I had never heard till then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you 
permit me to look at it?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;With 
pleasure,&rdquo; he answered, politely handing me the book.&nbsp;
I took the volume, and glanced over the contents.&nbsp; It was 
written in blank verse, and appeared to abound in descriptions of
scenery; there was much mention of mountains, valleys, streams 
and waterfalls, harebells, and daffodils.&nbsp; These 
descriptions were interspersed with dialogues, which, though they
proceeded from the mouths of pedlars and rustics, were of the 
most edifying description; mostly on subjects moral or 
metaphysical, and couched in the most gentlemanly and 
unexceptionable language, without the slightest mixture of 
vulgarity, coarseness, or piebald grammar.&nbsp; Such appeared to
me to be the contents of the book; but before I could form a very
clear idea of them, I found myself nodding, and a surprising 
desire to sleep coming over me.&nbsp; Rousing myself, however, by
a strong effort, I closed the book, and, returning it to the 
owner, inquired of him, &ldquo;Whether he had any motive in 
coming and lying down in the meadow, besides the wish of enjoying
sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; he replied; 
&ldquo;indeed, I should be very glad not to be compelled to do 
so, always provided I could enjoy the blessing of sleep; for by 
lying down under <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>trees, I may possibly catch the 
rheumatism, or be stung by serpents; and, moreover, in the rainy 
season and winter the thing will be impossible, unless I erect a 
tent, which will possibly destroy the charm.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you need give yourself no 
further trouble about coming here, as I am fully convinced that 
with this book in your hand, you may go to sleep anywhere, as 
your friend was doubtless aware, though he wished to interest 
your imagination for a time by persuading you to lie abroad; 
therefore, in future, whenever you feel disposed to sleep, try to
read the book, and you will be sound asleep in a minute; the 
narcotic influence lies in the book, and not in the 
field.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will follow your advice,&rdquo; said
the individual, &ldquo;and this very night take it with me to 
bed; though I hope in time to be able to sleep without it, my 
nerves being already much quieted from the slumbers I have 
enjoyed in this field.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then moved towards the 
gate, where we parted; he going one way, and I and my horse the 
other.</p>
<p>More than twenty years subsequent to this period, after much 
wandering about the world, returning to my native country, I was 
invited to a literary tea-party, where, the discourse turning 
upon poetry, I, in order to show that I was not more ignorant 
than my neighbours, began to talk about Byron, for whose writings
I really entertained a considerable admiration, though I had no 
particular esteem for the man himself.&nbsp; At first I received 
no answer to what I said&mdash;the company merely surveying me 
with a kind of sleepy stare.&nbsp; At length a lady, about the 
age of forty, with a large wart on her face, observed in a 
drawling tone, &ldquo;That she had not read Byron&mdash;at least 
since her girlhood&mdash;and then only a few passages; but that 
the impression on her mind was, that his writings were of a 
highly objectionable character.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I also read a
little of him in my boyhood,&rdquo; said a gentleman, about 
sixty, but who evidently, from his dress and demeanour, wished to
appear about thirty, &ldquo;but I highly disapproved of him; for,
notwithstanding he was a nobleman, he is frequently very coarse, 
and very fond of raising emotion.&nbsp; Now emotion is what I 
dislike;&rdquo; drawling out the last syllable of the word 
dislike.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is only one poet for me&mdash;the 
divine . . .&rdquo;&mdash;and then he mentioned a name which I 
had only once heard, and afterwards quite forgotten; the name 
mentioned by the snorer in the field.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! there is 
no one like him!&rdquo; murmured some more of the company; 
&ldquo;the poet of nature&mdash;of nature without its 
vulgarity.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wished very <!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>much to ask
these people whether they were ever bad sleepers, and whether 
they had read the poet, so called, from a desire of being set to 
sleep.&nbsp; Within a few days, however, I learned that it had of
late become very fashionable and genteel to appear half asleep, 
and that one could exhibit no better mark of superfine breeding 
than by occasionally in company setting one&rsquo;s ronchal organ
in action.&nbsp; I then ceased to wonder at the popularity, which
I found nearly universal, of . . .&rsquo;s poetry; for, certainly
in order to make one&rsquo;s self appear sleepy in company, or 
occasionally to induce sleep, nothing could be more efficacious 
than a slight pre-lection of his poems.&nbsp; So, poor Byron, 
with his fire and emotion&mdash;to say nothing of his mouthings 
and coxcombry&mdash;was dethroned, as I had prophesied he would 
be more than twenty years before, on the day of his funeral, 
though I had little idea that his humiliation would have been 
brought about by one whose sole strength consists in setting 
people to sleep.&nbsp; Well, all things are doomed to terminate 
in sleep.&nbsp; Before that termination, however, I will venture 
to prophesy that people will become a little more 
awake&mdash;snoring and yawning be a little less in 
fashion&mdash;and poor Byron be once more reinstated on his 
throne, though his rival will always stand a good chance of being
worshipped by those whose ruined nerves are insensible to the 
narcotic powers of opium and morphine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>DRIVERS AND FRONT OUTSIDE PASSENGERS&mdash;FATIGUE OF BODY AND
MIND&mdash;UNEXPECTED GREETING&mdash;MY INN&mdash;THE 
GOVERNOR&mdash;ENGAGEMENT.</p>
<p>I continued my journey, passing through one or two 
villages.&nbsp; The day was exceedingly hot, and the roads 
dusty.&nbsp; In order to cause my horse as little fatigue as 
possible, and not to chafe his back, I led him by the bridle, my 
doing which brought upon me a shower of remarks, jests, and 
would-be witticisms from the drivers and front outside passengers
of sundry stagecoaches, which passed me in one direction or the 
other.&nbsp; In this way I proceeded till considerably past noon,
when I felt myself very fatigued, and my horse appeared no less 
so; and it is probable that the lazy and listless manner in which
we were <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>moving on tired us both much more 
effectually than hurrying along at a swift trot would have done, 
for I have observed that when the energies of the body are not 
exerted a languor frequently comes over it.&nbsp; At length, 
arriving at a very large building with an archway, near the 
entrance of a town, I sat down on what appeared to be a 
stepping-block, and presently experienced a great depression of 
spirits.&nbsp; I began to ask myself whither I was going, and 
what I should do with myself and the horse which I held by the 
bridle?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I was alone in the world 
with the poor animal, who looked for support to me, who knew not 
how to support myself.&nbsp; Then the image of Isopel Berners 
came into my mind, and when I bethought me how I had lost her for
ever, and how happy I might have been with her in the New World 
had she not deserted me, I became yet more miserable.</p>
<p>As I sat in this frame of mind, I suddenly felt some one clap 
me on the shoulder, and heard a voice say, &ldquo;Ha! comrade of 
the dingle, what chance has brought you into these 
parts?&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned round, and beheld a man in the dress
of a postillion, whom I instantly recognised as he to whom I had 
rendered assistance on the night of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is it you?&nbsp; I am glad to
see you, for I was feeling very lonely and melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely and melancholy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;how is
that? how can any one be lonely and melancholy with such a noble 
horse as that you hold by the bridle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is one cause of my 
melancholy, for I know not in the world what to do with 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may call it my own, though
I borrowed the money to purchase it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always easy to find a purchaser for a horse 
like this,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;can you recommend me 
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Why, no, not exactly; but you&rsquo;ll find a 
purchaser shortly&mdash;pooh! if you have no other cause for 
disquiet than that horse, cheer up, man, don&rsquo;t be cast 
down.&nbsp; Have you nothing else on your mind?&nbsp; By-the-bye,
what&rsquo;s become of the young women you were keeping company 
with in that queer lodging-place of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has left me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You quarrelled, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we did not exactly 
quarrel, but we are parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but you will soon come 
together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are parted for 
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever!&nbsp; Pooh! you little know how people 
sometimes come together again who think they are parted for 
ever.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s something on that point relating to 
myself.&nbsp; You remember, when I told you my story in that 
dingle of yours, that I mentioned a young woman, my 
fellow-servant when I lived with the English family in Mumbo 
Jumbo&rsquo;s town, and how she and I, when our foolish governors
were thinking of changing their religion, agreed to stand by each
other, and be true to old Church of England, and to give our 
governors warning, provided they tried to make us 
renegades.&nbsp; Well, she and I parted soon after that, and 
never thought to meet again, yet we met the other day in the 
fields, for she lately came to live with a great family not far 
from here, and we have since agreed to marry, to take a little 
farm, for we have both a trifle of money, and live together till 
&lsquo;death us do part.&rsquo;&nbsp; So much for parting for 
ever!&nbsp; But what do I mean by keeping you broiling in the sun
with your horse&rsquo;s bridle in your hand, and you on my own 
ground?&nbsp; Do you know where you are?&nbsp; Why, that great 
house is my inn, that is, it&rsquo;s my master&rsquo;s, the best 
fellow in . . . Come along, you and your horse both will find a 
welcome at my inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he led the way into a large court in which there 
were coaches, chaises, and a great many people; taking my horse 
from me, he led it into a nice cool stall, and fastened it to the
rack&mdash;he then conducted me into a postillion&rsquo;s 
keeping-room, which at that time chanced to be empty, and he then
fetched a pot of beer and sat down by me.</p>
<p>After a little conversation he asked me what I intended to do,
and I told him frankly that I did not know; whereupon he observed
that, provided I had no objection, he had little doubt that I 
could be accommodated for some time at his inn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our 
upper ostler,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;died about a week ago; he 
was a clever fellow, and, besides his trade, understood reading 
and accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him, &ldquo;I am 
not fitted for the place of ostler&mdash;moreover, I refused the 
place of ostler at a public-house, which was offered to me only a
few days ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; The postillion burst into a 
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ostler at a public-house, indeed! why, you 
would not compare a berth at a place like that with the situation
of ostler at my inn, the first road-house <!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>in 
England!&nbsp; However, I was not thinking of the place of ostler
for you; you are, as you say, not fitted for it, at any rate not 
at a house like this.&nbsp; We have, moreover, the best 
under-ostler in all England&mdash;old Bill, with the drawback 
that he is rather fond of drink.&nbsp; We could make shift with 
him very well, provided we could fall in with a man of writing 
and figures, who could give an account of the hay and corn which 
comes in and goes out, and wouldn&rsquo;t object to give a look 
occasionally at the yard.&nbsp; Now it appears to me that you are
just such a kind of man, and if you will allow me to speak to the
governor, I don&rsquo;t doubt that he will gladly take you, as he
feels kindly disposed towards you from what he has heard me say 
concerning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what should I do with my horse?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse need give you no uneasiness,&rdquo; said the 
postillion; &ldquo;I know he will be welcome here both for bed 
and manger, and perhaps in a little time you may find a 
purchaser, as a vast number of sporting people frequent this 
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; I offered two or three more objections, which
the postillion overcame with great force of argument, and the pot
being nearly empty, he drained it to the bottom drop, and then 
starting up, left me alone.</p>
<p>In about twenty minutes he returned, accompanied by a highly 
intelligent-looking individual dressed in blue and black, with a 
particularly white cravat, and without a hat on his head; this 
individual, whom I should have mistaken for a gentleman but for 
the intelligence depicted in his face, he introduced to me as the
master of the inn.&nbsp; The master of the inn shook me warmly by
the hand, told me that he was happy to see me in his house, and 
thanked me in the handsomest terms for the kindness I had shown 
to his servant in the affair of the thunder-storm.&nbsp; Then 
saying that he was informed I was out of employ, he assured me 
that he should be most happy to engage me to keep his hay and 
corn account, and as general superintendent of the yard, and that
with respect to the horse which he was told I had, he begged to 
inform me that I was perfectly at liberty to keep it at the inn 
upon the very best, until I could find a purchaser,&mdash;that 
with regard to wages&mdash;but he had no sooner mentioned wages 
than I cut him short, saying, that provided I stayed I should be 
most happy to serve him for bed and board, and requested that he 
would allow me until the next morning to consider of his offer; 
he willingly consented to my request, and, begging that I would 
call for anything I pleased, left me alone with the 
postillion.</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>I passed that night until about ten o&rsquo;clock with 
the postillion, when he left me, having to drive a family about 
ten miles across the country; before his departure, however, I 
told him that I had determined to accept the offer of his 
governor, as he called him.&nbsp; At the bottom of my heart I was
most happy that an offer had been made, which secured to myself 
and the animal a comfortable retreat at a moment when I knew not 
whither in the world to take myself and him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>AN INN OF TIMES GONE BY&mdash;A FIRST-RATE PUBLICAN&mdash;HAY 
AND CORN&mdash;OLD-FASHIONED 
OSTLER&mdash;HIGHWAYMEN&mdash;MOUNTED POLICE&mdash;GROOMING.</p>
<p>The inn, of which I had become an inhabitant, was a place of 
infinite life and bustle.&nbsp; Travellers of all descriptions, 
from all the cardinal points, were continually stopping at it; 
and to attend to their wants, and minister to their convenience, 
an army of servants, of one description or other, was kept: 
waiters, chambermaids, grooms, postillions, shoe-blacks, cooks, 
scullions, and what not, for there was a barber and hair-dresser,
who had been at Paris, and talked French with a cockney accent; 
the French sounding all the better, as no accent is so melodious 
as the cockney.&nbsp; Jacks creaked in the kitchens turning round
spits, on which large joints of meat piped and smoked before the 
great big fires.&nbsp; There was running up and down stairs, and 
along galleries, slamming of doors, cries of &ldquo;Coming, 
sir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Please to step this way, 
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; during eighteen hours of the 
four-and-twenty.&nbsp; Truly a very great place for life and 
bustle was this inn.&nbsp; And often in after life, when lonely 
and melancholy, I have called up the time I spent there, and 
never failed to become cheerful from the recollection.</p>
<p>I found the master of the house a very kind and civil 
person.&nbsp; Before being an inn-keeper he had been in some 
other line of business, but on the death of the former proprietor
of the inn had married his widow, who was still alive, but being 
somewhat infirm, lived in a retired part of the house.&nbsp; I 
have said that he was kind and civil; he was, however, not one of
those people who suffer themselves to be made fools of by 
anybody; he <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>knew his customers, and had a calm 
clear eye, which would look through a man without seeming to do 
so.&nbsp; The accommodation of his house was of the very best 
description; his wines were good, his viands equally so, and his 
charges not immoderate; though he very properly took care of 
himself.&nbsp; He was no vulgar inn-keeper, had a host of 
friends, and deserved them all.&nbsp; During the time I lived 
with him, he was presented, by a large assemblage of his friends 
and customers, with a dinner at his own house, which was very 
costly, and at which the best of wines were sported, and after 
the dinner with a piece of plate, estimated at fifty 
guineas.&nbsp; He received the plate, made a neat speech of 
thanks, and when the bill was called for, made another neat 
speech, in which he refused to receive one farthing for the 
entertainment, ordering in at the same time two dozen more of the
best champagne, and sitting down amidst uproarious applause, and 
cries of &ldquo;You shall be no loser by it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
very wonderful in such conduct, some people will say; I 
don&rsquo;t say there is, nor have I any intention to endeavour 
to persuade the reader that the landlord was a Carlo Borromeo; he
merely gave a quid pro quo; but it is not every person who will 
give you a quid pro quo.&nbsp; Had he been a vulgar publican, he 
would have sent in a swinging bill after receiving the plate; 
&ldquo;but then no vulgar publican would have been presented with
plate;&rdquo; perhaps not, but many a vulgar public character has
been presented with plate, whose admirers never received a quid 
pro quo, except in the shape of a swinging bill.</p>
<p>I found my duties of distributing hay and corn, and keeping an
account thereof, anything but disagreeable, particularly after I 
had acquired the good-will of the old ostler, who at first looked
upon me with rather an evil eye, considering me somewhat in the 
light of one who had usurped an office which belonged to himself 
by the right of succession; but there was little gall in the old 
fellow, and by speaking kindly to him, never giving myself any 
airs of assumption, but, above all, by frequently reading the 
newspapers to him&mdash;for, though passionately fond of news and
politics, he was unable to read&mdash;I soon succeeded in placing
myself on excellent terms with him.&nbsp; A regular character was
that old ostler; he was a Yorkshireman by birth, but had seen a 
great deal of life in the vicinity of London, to which, on the 
death of his parents, who were very poor people, he went at a 
very early age.&nbsp; Amongst <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>other 
places where he had served as ostler was a small inn at Hounslow,
much frequented by highwaymen, whose exploits he was fond of 
narrating, especially those of Jerry Abershaw, who, he said, was 
a capital rider; and on hearing his accounts of that worthy I 
half regretted that the old fellow had not been in London, and I 
had not formed his acquaintance about the time I was thinking of 
writing the life of the said Abershaw, not doubting that with his
assistance I could have produced a book at least as remarkable as
the life and adventures of that entirely imaginary personage, 
Joseph Sell; perhaps, however, I was mistaken; and whenever 
Abershaw&rsquo;s life shall appear before the public&mdash;and my
publisher credibly informs me that it has not yet 
appeared&mdash;I beg and entreat the public to state which it 
likes best, the life of Abershaw, or that of Sell, for which 
latter work I am informed that during the last few months there 
has been a prodigious demand.&nbsp; My old friend, however, after
talking of Abershaw, would frequently add that, good rider as 
Abershaw certainly was, he was decidedly inferior to Richard 
Ferguson, generally called Galloping Dick, who was a pal of 
Abershaw&rsquo;s, and had enjoyed a career as long, and nearly as
remarkable, as his own.&nbsp; I learned from him that both were 
capital customers at the Hounslow inn, and that he had frequently
drank with them in the corn-room.&nbsp; He said that no man could
desire more jolly or entertaining companions over a glass of 
&ldquo;summut,&rdquo; but that upon the road it was anything but 
desirable to meet them; there they were terrible, cursing and 
swearing, and thrusting the muzzles of their pistols into 
people&rsquo;s mouths; and at this part of his locution the old 
man winked, and said, in a somewhat lower voice, that upon the 
whole they were right in doing so, and that when a person had 
once made up his mind to become a highwayman, his best policy was
to go the whole hog, fearing nothing, but making everybody afraid
of him; that people never thought of resisting a savage-faced, 
foul-mouthed highwayman, and if he were taken, were afraid to 
bear witness against him, lest he should get off and cut their 
throats some time or other upon the roads; whereas people would 
resist being robbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal, and would
swear bodily against him on the first opportunity,&mdash;adding, 
that Abershaw and Ferguson, two most awful fellows, had enjoyed a
long career, whereas two disbanded officers of the army, who 
wished to rob a coach like gentlemen, had begged the 
passengers&rsquo; pardon, <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and talked 
of hard necessity, had been set upon by the passengers 
themselves, amongst whom were three women, pulled from their 
horses, conducted to Maidstone, and hanged with as little pity as
such contemptible fellows deserved.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing
like going the whole hog,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and if ever 
I had been a highwayman, I would have done so; I should have 
thought myself all the more safe; and, moreover, shouldn&rsquo;t 
have despised myself.&nbsp; To curry favour with those you are 
robbing, sometimes at the expense of your own comrades, as I have
known fellows do, why, it is the greatest . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; interposed my friend the postillion, 
who chanced to be present at a considerable part of the old 
ostler&rsquo;s discourse; &ldquo;it is, as you say, the greatest 
of humbug, and merely, after all, gets a fellow into trouble; but
no regular bred highwayman would do it.&nbsp; I say, George, 
catch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he 
robs; catch old Mumbo Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop 
of Canterbury and the Dean and Chapter, should he meet them in a 
stage-coach; it would be with him, Bricconi Abbasso, as he 
knocked their teeth out with the butt of his trombone; and the 
old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer for it, as Bill 
would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after such a
spice of his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and 
to hang him, even if he were in their power, though that would be
the proper way; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a 
highwayman to curry favour with those he robs, the next greatest 
is to try to curry favour with a highwayman when you have got 
him, by letting him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding the old man so well acquainted with the history of 
highwaymen, and taking considerable interest in the subject, 
having myself edited a book containing the lives of many 
remarkable people who had figured on the highway, I forthwith 
asked him how it was that the trade of highwayman had become 
extinct in England, as at present we never heard of any one 
following it.&nbsp; Whereupon he told me that many causes had 
contributed to bring about that result; the principal of which 
were the following:&mdash;the refusal to license houses which 
were known to afford shelter to highwaymen, which amongst many 
others, had caused the inn at Hounslow to be closed; the 
inclosure of many a wild heath in the country, on which they were
in the habit of lurking, and particularly the establishing in the
neighbourhood of London of a well-armed <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>mounted 
patrol, who rode the highwaymen down, and delivered them up to 
justice, which hanged them without ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and 
his gang,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;should they show 
their visages in these realms; and I hear by the newspapers that 
they are becoming every day more desperate.&nbsp; Take away the 
licence from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries and 
shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in 
order to sally out upon people as they pass in the roads; but, 
above all, establish a good mounted police to ride after the 
ruffians and drag them by the scruff of the neck to the next 
clink, where they might lie till they could be properly dealt 
with by law; instead of which, the Government are repealing the 
wise old laws enacted against such characters, giving fresh 
licences every day to their public-houses, and saying that it 
would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and thickets, because
they look so very picturesque; and, in fact, giving them all kind
of encouragement; why, if such behaviour is not enough to drive 
an honest man mad, I know not what is.&nbsp; It is of no use 
talking, I only wish the power were in my hands, and if I did not
make short work of them, might I be a mere jackass postillion all
the remainder of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides acquiring from the ancient ostler a great deal of 
curious information respecting the ways and habits of the heroes 
of the road, with whom he had come in contact in the early 
portion of his life, I picked up from him many excellent hints 
relating to the art of grooming horses.&nbsp; Whilst at the inn, 
I frequently groomed the stage and post-horses, and those driven 
up by travellers in their gigs: I was not compelled, nor indeed 
expected, to do so; but I took pleasure in the occupation; and I 
remember at that period one of the principal objects of my 
ambition was to be a first-rate groom, and to make the skins of 
the creatures I took in hand look sleek and glossy like those of 
moles.&nbsp; I have said that I derived valuable hints from the 
old man, and, indeed, became a very tolerable groom, but there 
was a certain finishing touch which I could never learn from him,
though he possessed it himself, and which I could never attain to
by my own endeavours; though my want of success certainly did not
proceed from want of application, for I have rubbed the horses 
down, purring and buzzing all the time, after the genuine ostler 
fashion, until the perspiration fell in heavy drops upon my 
shoes, and when <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>I had done my best, and asked the 
old fellow what he thought of my work, I could never extract from
him more than a kind of grunt, which might be translated, 
&ldquo;Not so very bad, but I have seen a horse groomed much 
better,&rdquo; which leads me to suppose that a person, in order 
to be a first-rate groom, must have something in him when he is 
born which I had not, and, indeed, which many other people have 
not who pretend to be grooms.&nbsp; What does the reader 
think?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p>STABLE HARTSHORN&mdash;HOW TO MANAGE A HORSE ON A 
JOURNEY&mdash;YOUR BEST FRIEND.</p>
<p>Of one thing I am certain, that the reader must be much 
delighted with the wholesome smell of the stable, with which many
of these pages are redolent; what a contrast to the sickly odours
exhaled from those of some of my contemporaries, especially of 
those who pretend to be of the highly fashionable class, and who 
treat of reception-rooms, well may they be styled so, in which 
dukes, duchesses, earls, countesses, archbishops, bishops, 
mayors, mayoresses&mdash;not forgetting the writers themselves, 
both male and female&mdash;congregate and press upon one another;
how cheering, how refreshing, after having been nearly knocked 
down with such an atmosphere, to come in contact with genuine 
stable hartshorn.&nbsp; Oh! the reader shall have yet more of the
stable, and of that old ostler, for which he or she will 
doubtless exclaim, &ldquo;Much obliged!&rdquo;&mdash;and lest I 
should forget to perform my promise, the reader shall have it 
now.</p>
<p>I shall never forget a harangue from the mouth of the old man,
which I listened to one warm evening as he and I sat on the 
threshold of the stable, after having attended to some of the 
wants of a batch of coach-horses.&nbsp; It related to the manner 
in which a gentleman should take care of his horse and self 
whilst engaged in a journey on horseback, and was addressed to 
myself on the supposition of my one day coming to an estate, and 
of course becoming a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should
you ever wish to take a journey on a horse of your own, and you 
could not have a much better than the one you have here eating 
its fill in the box yonder&mdash;I wonder, by-the-bye, how you 
ever came <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>by it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do 
better than follow the advice I am about to give you, both with 
respect to your animal and yourself.&nbsp; Before you start, 
merely give your horse a couple of handfuls of corn and a little 
water, somewhat under a quart, and if you drink a pint of water 
yourself out of the pail, you will feel all the better during the
whole day; then you may walk and trot your animal for about ten 
miles, till you come to some nice inn, where you may get down and
see your horse led into a nice stall, telling the ostler not to 
feed him till you come.&nbsp; If the ostler happens to be a 
dog-fancier, and has an English terrier dog like that of mine 
there, say what a nice dog it is, and praise its black and tawn; 
and if he does not happen to be a dog-fancier, ask him how 
he&rsquo;s getting on, and whether he ever knew worse times; that
kind of thing will please the ostler, and he will let you do just
what you please with your own horse, and when your back is 
turned, he&rsquo;ll say to his comrades what a nice gentleman you
are, and how he thinks he has seen you before; then go and sit 
down to breakfast, and before you have finished breakfast, get up
and go and give your horse a feed of corn; chat with the ostler 
two or three minutes till your horse has taken the shine out of 
his corn, which will prevent the ostler taking any of it away 
when your back is turned, for such things are sometimes 
done&mdash;not that I ever did such a thing myself when I was at 
the inn at Hounslow.&nbsp; Oh, dear me, no!&nbsp; Then go and 
finish your breakfast, and when you have finished your breakfast 
and called for the newspaper, go and water your horse, letting 
him have about one pailful, then give him another feed of corn, 
and enter into discourse with the ostler about bull-baiting, the 
prime minister, and the like; and when your horse has once more 
taken the shine out of his corn, go back to your room and your 
newspaper&mdash;and I hope for your sake it may be the 
<i>Globe</i>, for that&rsquo;s the best paper going,&mdash;then 
pull the bell-rope and order in your bill, which you will pay 
without counting it up&mdash;supposing you to be a 
gentleman.&nbsp; Give the waiter sixpence, and order out your 
horse, and when your horse is out, pay for the corn, and give the
ostler a shilling, then mount your horse and walk him gently for 
five miles; and whilst you are walking him in this manner, it may
be as well to tell you to take care that you do not let him down 
and smash his knees, more especially if the road be a 
particularly good one, for it is not at a desperate hiverman 
pace, and over very bad roads, <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>that a 
horse tumbles and smashes his knees, but on your particularly 
nice road, when the horse is going gently and lazily, and is half
asleep, like the gemman on his back; well, at the end of the five
miles, when the horse has digested his food, and is all right, 
you may begin to push your horse on, trotting him a mile at a 
heat, and then walking him a quarter of a one, that his wind may 
be not distressed; and you may go on in that manner for thirty 
miles, never galloping of course, for none but fools or hivermen 
ever gallop horses on roads; and at the end of that distance you 
may stop at some other nice inn for dinner.&nbsp; I say, when 
your horse is led into the stable, after that same thirty miles 
trotting and walking, don&rsquo;t let the saddle be whisked off 
at once, for if you do your horse will have such a sore back as 
will frighten you, but let your saddle remain on your 
horse&rsquo;s back, with the girths loosened, till after his next
feed of corn, and be sure that he has no corn, much less water, 
till after a long hour and more; after he is fed he may be 
watered to the tune of half a pail, and then the ostler can give 
him a regular rub down; you may then sit down to dinner, and when
you have dined get up and see to your horse as you did after 
breakfast, in fact you must do much after the same fashion you 
did at t&rsquo;other inn; see to your horse, and by no means 
disoblige the ostler.&nbsp; So when you have seen to your horse a
second time, you will sit down to your bottle of 
wine&mdash;supposing you to be a gentleman&mdash;and after you 
have finished it, and your argument about the corn laws with any 
commercial gentleman who happens to be in the room, you may mount
your horse again&mdash;not forgetting to do the proper thing to 
the waiter and ostler; you may mount your horse again and ride 
him, as you did before, for about five-and-twenty miles, at the 
end of which you may put up for the night after a very fair 
day&rsquo;s journey, for no gentleman&mdash;supposing he weighs 
sixteen stone, as I suppose you will by the time you become a 
gentleman&mdash;ought to ride a horse more than sixty-five miles 
in one day, provided he has any regard for his horse&rsquo;s 
back, or his own either.&nbsp; See to your horse at night, and 
have him well rubbed down.&nbsp; The next day you may ride your 
horse forty miles just as you please, but never foolishly, and 
those forty miles will bring you to your journey&rsquo;s end, 
unless your journey be a plaguy long one, and if so, never ride 
your horse more than five-and-thirty miles a day, always however,
seeing him well fed, and taking more care of him than <!-- page 
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
144</span>yourself; which is but right and reasonable, seeing as 
how the horse is the best animal of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a gentleman,&rdquo; said he, after a 
pause, &ldquo;the first thing you must think about is to provide 
yourself with a good horse for your own particular riding; you 
will, perhaps, keep a coach and pair, but they will be less your 
own than your lady&rsquo;s, should you have one, and your young 
gentry, should you have any; or, if you have neither, for madam, 
your housekeeper, and the upper female servants; so you need 
trouble your head less about them, though, of course, you would 
not like to pay away your money for screws; but be sure you get a
good horse for your own riding; and that you may have a good 
chance of having a good one, buy one that&rsquo;s young and has 
plenty of belly&mdash;a little more than the one has which you 
now have, though you are not yet a gentleman; you will, of 
course, look to his head, his withers, legs, and other points, 
but never buy a horse at any price that has not plenty of 
belly&mdash;no horse that has not belly is ever a good feeder, 
and a horse that a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a good feeder can&rsquo;t be a
good horse; never buy a horse that is drawn up in the belly 
behind, a horse of that description can&rsquo;t feed, and can 
never carry sixteen stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when you have got such a horse be proud of 
it&mdash;as I dare say you are of the one you have now&mdash;and 
wherever you go swear there a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t another to match it
in the country, and if anybody gives you the lie, take him by the
nose and tweak it off, just as you would do if anybody were to 
speak ill of your lady, or, for want of her, of your 
housekeeper.&nbsp; Take care of your horse, as you would of the 
apple of your eye&mdash;I am sure I would, if I were a gentleman,
which I don&rsquo;t ever expect to be, and hardly wish, seeing as
how I am sixty-nine, and am rather too old to ride&mdash;yes, 
cherish and take care of your horse as perhaps the best friend 
you have in the world; for, after all, who will carry you through
thick and thin as your horse will? not your gentlemen friends I 
warrant, nor your housekeeper, nor your upper servants, male or 
female; perhaps your lady would, that is, if she is a wopper, and
one of the right sort; the others would be more likely to take up
mud and pelt you with it, provided they saw you in trouble, than 
to help you.&nbsp; So take care of your horse, and feed him every
day with your own hands; give him three-quarters of a peck of 
corn each day, mixed up with a little hay-chaff, and allow him 
besides one hundred-weight <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of hay in 
the course of the week; some say that the hay should be hardland 
hay, because it is wholesomest, but I say, let it be clover hay, 
because the horse likes it best; give him through summer and 
winter, once a week, a pailful of bran mash, cold in summer and 
in winter hot; ride him gently about the neighbourhood every day,
by which means you will give exercise to yourself and horse, and,
moreover, have the satisfaction of exhibiting yourself and your 
horse to advantage, and hearing, perhaps, the men say what a fine
horse, and the ladies saying what a fine man: never let your 
groom mount your horse, as it is ten to one, if you do, your 
groom will be wishing to show off before company, and will fling 
your horse down.&nbsp; I was groom to a gemman before I went to 
the inn at Hounslow, and flung him a horse down worth ninety 
guineas, by endeavouring to show off before some ladies that I 
met on the road.&nbsp; Turn your horse out to grass throughout 
May and the first part of June, for then the grass is sweetest, 
and the flies don&rsquo;t sting so bad as they do later in 
summer: afterwards merely turn him out occasionally in the swale 
of the morn and the evening; after September the grass is good 
for little, lash and sour at best: every horse should go out to 
grass, if not, his blood becomes full of greasy humours, and his 
wind is apt to become affected, but he ought to be kept as much 
as possible from the heat and flies, always got up at night, and 
never turned out late in the year&mdash;Lord! if I had always 
such a nice attentive person to listen to me as you are, I could 
go on talking about &rsquo;orses to the end of time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p>THE STAGE-COACHMEN OF ENGLAND&mdash;A BULLY SERVED 
OUT&mdash;BROUGHTON&rsquo;S GUARD&mdash;THE BRAZEN HEAD.</p>
<p>I lived on very good terms, not only with the master and the 
old ostler, but with all the domestics and hangers-on at the inn;
waiters, chambermaids, cooks, and scullions, not forgetting the 
&ldquo;boots,&rdquo; of which there were three.&nbsp; As for the 
postillions, I was sworn brother with them all, and some of them 
went so far as to swear that I was the best fellow in the world; 
for which high opinion entertained by them of me, I <!-- page 
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
146</span>believe I was principally indebted to the good account 
their comrade gave of me, whom I had so hospitably received in 
the dingle.&nbsp; I repeat that I lived on good terms with all 
the people connected with the inn, and was noticed and spoken 
kindly to by some of the guests&mdash;especially by that class 
termed commercial travellers&mdash;all of whom were great friends
and patronisers of the landlord, and were the principal promoters
of the dinner, and subscribers to the gift of plate, which I have
already spoken of, the whole fraternity striking me as the 
jolliest set of fellows imaginable, the best customers to an inn,
and the most liberal to servants; there was one description of 
persons, however, frequenting the inn which I did not like at 
all, and which I did not get on well with, and these people were 
the stage-coachmen.</p>
<p>The stage-coachmen of England, at the time of which I am 
speaking, considered themselves mighty fine gentry, nay, I verily
believe the most important personages of the realm, and their 
entertaining this high opinion of themselves can scarcely be 
wondered at; they were low fellows, but masters of driving; 
driving was in fashion, and sprigs of nobility used to dress as 
coachmen and imitate the slang and behaviour of coachmen, from 
whom occasionally they would take lessons in driving as they sat 
beside them on the box, which post of honour any sprig of 
nobility who happened to take a place on a coach claimed as his 
unquestionable right; and then these sprigs would smoke cigars 
and drink sherry with the coachmen in bar-rooms, and on the road;
and, when bidding them farewell, would give them a guinea or a 
half-guinea, and shake them by the hand, so that these fellows, 
being low fellows, very naturally thought no small liquor of 
themselves, but would talk familiarly of their friends lords so 
and so, the honourable misters so and so, and Sir Harry and Sir 
Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one who was not a lord, 
or something of the kind; and this high opinion of themselves 
received daily augmentation from the servile homage paid them by 
the generality of the untitled male passengers, especially those 
on the fore part of the coach, who used to contend for the honour
of sitting on the box with the coachman when no sprig was nigh to
put in his claim.&nbsp; Oh! what servile homage these craven 
creatures did pay these same coach fellows, more especially after
witnessing this or t&rsquo;other act of brutality practised upon 
the weak and unoffending&mdash;upon some poor friendless woman 
travelling <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>with but little money, and perhaps a
brace of hungry children with her, or upon some thin and 
half-starved man travelling on the hind part of the coach from 
London to Liverpool, with only eighteen pence in his pocket after
his fare was paid, to defray his expenses on the road; for as the
insolence of these knights was vast, so was their rapacity 
enormous; they had been so long accustomed to have crowns and 
half-crowns rained upon them by their admirers and flatterers, 
that they would look at a shilling, for which many an honest 
labourer was happy to toil for ten hours under a broiling sun, 
with the utmost contempt; would blow upon it derisively, or 
fillip it into the air before they pocketed it; but when nothing 
was given them, as would occasionally happen&mdash;for how could 
they receive from those who had nothing? and nobody was bound to 
give them anything, as they had certain wages from their 
employers&mdash;then what a scene would ensue!&nbsp; Truly the 
brutality and rapacious insolence of English coachmen had reached
a climax; it was time that these fellows should be disenchanted, 
and the time&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;was not far distant.&nbsp;
Let the craven dastards who used to curry favour with them, and 
applaud their brutality, lament their loss now that they and 
their vehicles have disappeared from the roads; I, who have ever 
been an enemy to insolence, cruelty, and tyranny, loathe their 
memory, and, what is more, am not afraid to say so, well aware of
the storm of vituperation, partly learned from them, which I may 
expect from those who used to fall down and worship them.</p>
<p>Amongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was 
called &ldquo;the bang-up coachman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drove to our 
inn, in the fore part of every day, one of what were called the 
fast coaches, and afterwards took back the corresponding 
vehicle.&nbsp; He stayed at our house about twenty minutes, 
during which time the passengers of the coach which he was to 
return with dined; those at least who were inclined for dinner, 
and could pay for it.&nbsp; He derived his sobriquet of 
&ldquo;the bang-up coachman&rdquo; partly from his being dressed 
in the extremity of coach dandyism, and partly from the peculiar 
insolence of his manner, and the unmerciful fashion in which he 
was in the habit of lashing on the poor horses committed to his 
charge.&nbsp; He was a large tall fellow, of about thirty, with a
face which, had it not been bloated by excess, and insolence and 
cruelty stamped most visibly upon it, might have been called 
good-looking.&nbsp; <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>His insolence indeed was so great 
that he was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches 
along the road upon which he drove, especially the ostlers, whom 
he was continually abusing or finding fault with.&nbsp; Many was 
the hearty curse which he received when his back was turned; but 
the generality of people were much afraid of him, for he was a 
swinging strong fellow, and had the reputation of being a 
fighter, and in one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous 
manner individuals who had quarrelled with him.</p>
<p>I was nearly having a fracas with this worthy.&nbsp; One day, 
after he had been drinking sherry with a sprig, he swaggered into
the yard where I happened to be standing; just then a waiter came
by carrying upon a tray part of a splendid Cheshire cheese, with 
a knife, plate, and napkin.&nbsp; Stopping the waiter, the 
coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large lump out of the 
very middle of the cheese, stuck it on the end of the knife, and 
putting it to his mouth nibbled a slight piece off it, and then, 
tossing the rest away with disdain, flung the knife down upon the
tray, motioning the waiter to proceed: &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;you may not want before you die what you have just 
flung away,&rdquo; whereupon the fellow turned furiously towards 
me; just then, however, his coach being standing at the door, 
there was a cry for coachman, so that he was forced to depart, 
contenting himself for the present with shaking his fist at me, 
and threatening to serve me out on the first opportunity; before,
however, the opportunity occurred he himself got served out in a 
most unexpected manner.</p>
<p>The day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn, and
after having dismounted and received the contributions of the 
generality of the passengers, he strutted up, with a cigar in his
mouth, to an individual who had come with him, and who had just 
asked me a question with respect to the direction of a village 
about three miles off, to which he was going.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Remember the coachman,&rdquo; said the knight of the box 
to this individual, who was a thin person of about sixty, with a 
white hat, rather shabby black coat, and buff-coloured trousers, 
and who held an umbrella and a small bundle in his hand.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;If you expect me to give you anything,&rdquo; said he to 
the coachman, &ldquo;you are mistaken; I will give you 
nothing.&nbsp; You have been very insolent to me as I rode behind
you on the coach, and have encouraged two or three trumpery 
fellows, who rode along with you, to cut scurvy jokes at my 
expense, and now you <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>come to me for money: I am not so 
poor but I could have given you a shilling had you been civil; as
it is I will give you nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! you 
won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the coachman; 
&ldquo;dear me!&nbsp; I hope I shan&rsquo;t starve because you 
won&rsquo;t give me anything&mdash;a shilling! why, I could 
afford to give you twenty if I thought fit, you pauper! civil to 
you, indeed! things are come to a fine pass if I need be civil to
you!&nbsp; Do you know who you are speaking to? why, the best 
lords in the country are proud to speak to me.&nbsp; Why, it was 
only the other day that the Marquis of . . . said to me . . 
.,&rdquo; and then he went on to say what the Marquis said to 
him; after which, flinging down his cigar, he strutted up the 
road, swearing to himself about paupers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is three miles to . . .,&rdquo; said the 
individual to me; &ldquo;I think I shall light my pipe, and smoke
it as I go along.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he took out from a 
side-pocket a tobacco-box and short meerschaum pipe, and 
implements for striking a light, filled his pipe, lighted it, and
commenced smoking.&nbsp; Presently the coachman drew near, I saw 
at once that there was mischief in his eye; the man smoking was 
standing with his back towards him, and he came <i>so</i> nigh to
him, seemingly purposely, that as he passed a puff of smoke came 
of necessity against his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by 
smoking in my face?&rdquo; said he, striking the pipe of the 
elderly individual out of his mouth.&nbsp; The other, without 
manifesting much surprise, said, &ldquo;I thank you; and if you 
will wait a minute, I will give you a receipt for that 
favour;&rdquo; then gathering up his pipe, and taking off his 
coat and hat, he laid them on a stepping-block which stood near, 
and rubbing his hands together, he advanced towards the coachman 
in an attitude of offence, holding his hands crossed very near to
his face.&nbsp; The coachman, who probably expected anything but 
such a movement from a person of the age and appearance of the 
individual whom he had insulted, stood for a moment motionless 
with surprise; but recollecting himself, he pointed at him 
derisively with his finger; the next moment, however, the other 
was close upon him, had struck aside the extended hand with his 
left fist, and given him a severe blow on the nose with his 
right, which he immediately followed by a left-hand blow in the 
eye; then drawing his body slightly backward, with the velocity 
of lightning he struck the coachman full in the mouth, and the 
last blow was the severest of all, for it cut the 
coachman&rsquo;s lips <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>nearly through; blows so quickly and
sharply dealt I had never seen.&nbsp; The coachman reeled like a 
fir-tree in a gale, and seemed nearly unsensed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! 
what&rsquo;s this? a fight! a fight!&rdquo; sounded from a dozen 
voices, and people came running from all directions to see what 
was going on.&nbsp; The coachman, coming somewhat to himself, 
disencumbered himself of his coat and hat; and, encouraged by two
or three of his brothers of the whip, showed some symptoms of 
fighting, endeavouring to close with his foe, but the attempt was
vain, his foe was not to be closed with; he did not shift or 
dodge about, but warded off the blows of his opponent with the 
greatest sang-froid, always using the guard which I have already 
described, and putting in, in return, short chopping blows with 
the swiftness of lightning.&nbsp; In a very few minutes the 
countenance of the coachman was literally cut to pieces, and 
several of his teeth were dislodged; at length he gave in; stung 
with mortification, however, he repented, and asked for another 
round; it was granted, to his own complete demolition.&nbsp; The 
coachman did not drive his coach back that day, he did not appear
on the box again for a week; but he never held up his head 
afterwards.&nbsp; Before I quitted the inn, he had disappeared 
from the road, going no one knew where.</p>
<p>The coachman, as I have said before, was very much disliked 
upon the road, but there was an <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst 
the coachmen, and those who stood by did not like to see their 
brother chastised in such tremendous fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
never saw such a fight before,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Fight! why, I don&rsquo;t call it a fight at all, this 
chap here ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a scratch, whereas Tom is cut to
pieces; it is all along of that guard of his; if Tom could have 
got within his guard he would have soon served the old chap 
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So he would,&rdquo; said another, 
&ldquo;it was all owing to that guard.&nbsp; However, I think I 
see into it, and if I had not to drive this afternoon, I would 
have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him 
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will fight him now for a 
guinea,&rdquo; said the other coachman, half taking off his coat;
observing, however, that the elderly individual made a motion 
towards him, he hitched it upon his shoulder again, and added, 
&ldquo;that is, if he had not been fighting already, but as it 
is, I am above taking an advantage, especially of such a poor old
creature as that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he had said this, he 
looked around him, and there was a feeble titter of approbation 
from two or three of the craven crew, who were in the habit of 
currying favour with the <!-- page 151--><a 
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>coachmen.&nbsp; The elderly individual looked for a 
moment at these last, and then said, &ldquo;To such fellows as 
you I have nothing to say;&rdquo; then turning to the coachmen, 
&ldquo;and as for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye cowardly 
bullies, I have but one word, which is, that your reign upon the 
roads is nearly over, and that a time is coming when ye will be 
no longer wanted or employed in your present capacity, when ye 
will either have to drive dung-carts, assist as ostlers at 
village ale-houses, or rot in the workhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
putting on his coat and hat, and taking up his bundle, not 
forgetting his meerschaum and the rest of his smoking apparatus, 
he departed on his way.&nbsp; Filled with curiosity, I followed 
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite astonished that you should be able to use 
your hands in the way you have done,&rdquo; said I, as I walked 
with this individual in the direction in which he was bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you how I became able to do so,&rdquo; said
the elderly individual, proceeding to fill and light his pipe as 
he walked along.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father was a journeyman 
engraver, who lived in a very riotous neighbourhood in the 
outskirts of London.&nbsp; Wishing to give me something of an 
education, he sent me to a day-school, two or three streets 
distant from where we lived, and there, being rather a puny boy, 
I suffered much persecution from my school-fellows, who were a 
very blackguard set.&nbsp; One day, as I was running home, with 
one of my tormentors pursuing me, old Sergeant Broughton, the 
retired fighting-man, seized me by the arm . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has it ever been your 
luck to be acquainted with Sergeant Broughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well call it luck,&rdquo; said the elderly 
individual; &ldquo;but for him I should never have been able to 
make my way through the world.&nbsp; He lived only four doors 
from our house; so, as I was running along the street, with my 
tyrant behind me, Sergeant Broughton seized me by the arm.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Stop my boy,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I have frequently seen
that scamp ill-treating you; now I will teach you how to send him
home with a bloody nose; down with your bag of books; and now, my
game chick,&rsquo; whispered he to me, placing himself between me
and my adversary, so that he could not observe his motions, 
&lsquo;clench your fist in this manner, and hold your arms in 
this, and when he strikes at you, move them as I now show you, 
and he can&rsquo;t hurt you; now, don&rsquo;t be afraid, but go 
at him.&rsquo;&nbsp; I confess that I was somewhat afraid, but I 
considered myself in <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>some degree under the protection of 
the famous Sergeant, and, clenching my fist, I went at my foe, 
using the guard which my ally recommended.&nbsp; The result 
corresponded to a certain degree with the predictions of the 
Sergeant; I gave my foe a bloody nose and a black eye, though, 
notwithstanding my recent lesson in the art of self-defence, he 
contrived to give me two or three clumsy blows.&nbsp; From that 
moment I was the especial favourite of the Sergeant, who gave me 
further lessons, so that in a little time I became a very fair 
boxer, beating everybody of my own size who attacked me.&nbsp; 
The old gentleman, however, made me promise never to be 
quarrelsome, nor to turn his instructions to account, except in 
self-defence.&nbsp; I have always borne in mind my promise, and 
have made it a point of conscience never to fight unless 
absolutely compelled.&nbsp; Folks may rail against boxing if they
please, but being able to box may sometimes stand a quiet man in 
good stead.&nbsp; How should I have fared to-day, but for the 
instructions of Sergeant Broughton?&nbsp; But for them, the 
brutal ruffian who insulted me must have passed unpunished.&nbsp;
He will not soon forget the lesson which I have just given 
him&mdash;the only lesson he could understand.&nbsp; What would 
have been the use of reasoning with a fellow of that 
description?&nbsp; Brave old Broughton!&nbsp; I owe him 
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your manner of fighting,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was 
the manner employed by Sergeant Broughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my new acquaintance; &ldquo;it was the
manner in which he beat every one who attempted to contend with 
him, till, in an evil hour he entered the ring with Slack, 
without any training or preparation, and by a chance blow lost 
the battle to a man who had been beaten with ease by those who, 
in the hands of Broughton, appeared like so many children.&nbsp; 
It was the way of fighting of him who first taught Englishmen to 
box scientifically, who was the head and father of the fighters 
of what is now called the old school, the last of which were 
Johnson and Big Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful man that Big Ben,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so,&rdquo; said the elderly individual; 
&ldquo;but had it not been for Broughton, I question whether Ben 
would have ever been the fighter he was.&nbsp; Oh! there is no 
one like old Broughton; but for him I should at the present 
moment be sneaking along the road, pursued by the hissings and 
hootings of the dirty flatterers of that blackguard 
coachman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;What did you mean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by 
those words of yours, that the coachmen would speedily disappear 
from the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that a new method of 
travelling is about to be established, which will supersede the 
old.&nbsp; I am a poor engraver, as my father was before me; but 
engraving is an intellectual trade, and by following it, I have 
been brought in contact with some of the cleverest men in 
England.&nbsp; It has even made me acquainted with the projector 
of the scheme, which he has told me many of the wisest heads of 
England have been dreaming of during a period of six hundred 
years, and which it seems was alluded to by a certain Brazen Head
in the story-book of Friar Bacon, who is generally supposed to 
have been a wizard, but in reality was a great philosopher.&nbsp;
Young man, in less than twenty years, by which time I shall be 
dead and gone, England will be surrounded with roads of metal, on
which armies may travel with mighty velocity, and of which the 
walls of brass and iron by which the friar proposed to defend his
native land are types.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then, shaking me by the 
hand, proceeded on his way, whilst I returned to the inn.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p>FRANCIS ARDRY&mdash;HIS MISFORTUNES&mdash;DOG AND LION 
FIGHT&mdash;GREAT MEN OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p>A few days after the circumstance which I have last 
commemorated, it chanced that, as I was standing at the door of 
the inn, one of the numerous stage-coaches which were in the 
habit of stopping there drove up, and several passengers got 
down.&nbsp; I had assisted a woman with a couple of children to 
dismount and had just delivered to her a bandbox, which appeared 
to be her only property, and which she had begged me to fetch 
down from the roof, when I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder and 
heard a voice exclaim, &ldquo;Is it possible, old fellow that I 
find you in this place?&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned round, and wrapped 
in a large blue cloak, I beheld my good friend Francis 
Ardry.&nbsp; I shook him most warmly by the hand, and said, 
&ldquo;If you are surprised to see me, I am no less so to see 
you; where are you bound to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound for L . . .; at any rate I am booked for 
that sea-port,&rdquo; said my friend in reply.</p>
<p><!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for in 
that case we shall have to part in a quarter of an hour, the 
coach by which you came stopping no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whither are you bound?&rdquo; demanded my 
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am stopping at present in this house, quite 
undetermined as to what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along with me,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can scarcely do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have a 
horse in the stall which I cannot afford to ruin by racing to L .
. . by the side of your coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend mused for a moment: &ldquo;I have no particular 
business at L . . .,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was merely going 
thither to pass a day or two, till an affair, in which I am 
deeply interested, at C . . . shall come off.&nbsp; I think I 
shall stay with you for four-and-twenty hours at least; I have 
been rather melancholy of late, and cannot afford to part with a 
friend like you at the present moment: it is an unexpected piece 
of good fortune to have met you; and I have not been very 
fortunate of late,&rdquo; he added, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am glad to see you once 
more, whether fortunate or not; where is your baggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon trunk is mine,&rdquo; said Francis, pointing to a 
trunk of black Russian leather upon the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will soon have it down,&rdquo; said I, and at a word
which I gave to one of the hangers-on of the inn, the trunk was 
taken from the top of the coach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I 
to Francis Ardry, &ldquo;follow me, I am a person of some 
authority in this house;&rdquo; thereupon I led Francis Ardry 
into the house, and a word which I said to a waiter forthwith 
installed Francis Ardry in a comfortable private sitting-room, 
and his trunk in the very best sleeping-room of our extensive 
establishment.</p>
<p>It was now about one o&rsquo;clock: Francis Ardry ordered 
dinner for two, to be ready at four, and a pint of sherry to be 
brought forthwith, which I requested my friend the waiter might 
be the very best, and which in effect turned out as I requested; 
we sat down, and when we had drank to each other&rsquo;s health, 
Frank requested me to make known to him how I had contrived to 
free myself from my embarrassments in London, what I had been 
about since I quitted that city, and the present posture of my 
affairs.</p>
<p>I related to Francis Ardry how I had composed the Life of 
Joseph Sell, and how the sale of it to the bookseller had <!-- 
page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
155</span>enabled me to quit London with money in my pocket, 
which had supported me during a long course of ramble in the 
country, into the particulars of which I, however, did not enter 
with any considerable degree of fulness.&nbsp; I summed up my 
account by saying that &ldquo;I was at present a kind of 
overlooker in the stables of the inn, had still some pounds in my
purse, and, moreover, a capital horse in the stall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No very agreeable posture of affairs,&rdquo; said 
Francis Ardry, looking rather seriously at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no complaints,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;my 
prospects are not very bright, it is true, but sometimes I have 
visions, both waking and sleeping, which, though always strange, 
are invariably agreeable.&nbsp; Last night, in my chamber near 
the hayloft, I dreamt that I had passed over an almost 
interminable wilderness&mdash;an enormous wall rose before me, 
the wall, methought, was the great wall of China:&mdash;strange 
figures appeared to be beckoning to me from the top of the wall; 
such visions are not exactly to be sneered at.&nbsp; Not that 
such phantasmagoria,&rdquo; said I, raising my voice, &ldquo;are 
to be compared for a moment with such desirable things as 
fashion, fine clothes, cheques from uncles, parliamentary 
interest, the love of splendid females.&nbsp; Ah! woman&rsquo;s 
love,&rdquo; said I, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the fellow?&rdquo; said 
Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like it,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, divine love,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound love,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, &ldquo;I hate
the very name; I have made myself a pretty fool by it, but trust 
me for ever being caught at such folly again.&nbsp; In an evil 
hour I abandoned my former pursuits and amusements for it; in one
morning spent at Joey&rsquo;s there was more real pleasure than 
in . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not hankering 
after dog-fighting again, a sport which none but the gross and 
unrefined care anything for?&nbsp; No, one&rsquo;s thoughts 
should be occupied by something higher and more rational than 
dog-fighting; and what better than love&mdash;divine love?&nbsp; 
Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Francis 
Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;why, I was repeating, 
to the best of my recollection, what I heard you say on a former 
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I talked such stuff,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry,
&ldquo;I was a <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>fool; and indeed I cannot deny that 
I have been one: no, there is no denying that I have been a 
fool.&nbsp; What do you think? that false Annette has cruelly 
abandoned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps you have yourself 
to thank for her having done so; did you never treat her with 
coldness, and repay her marks of affectionate interest with 
strange fits of eccentric humour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! how little you know of women,&rdquo; said Francis
Ardry; &ldquo;had I done as you suppose, I should probably have 
possessed her at the present moment.&nbsp; I treated her in a 
manner diametrically opposite to that.&nbsp; I loaded her with 
presents, was always most assiduous to her, always at her feet, 
as I may say, yet she nevertheless abandoned me&mdash;and for 
whom?&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to say&mdash;for a 
fiddler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a glass of wine, Francis Ardry followed my example, and
then proceeded to detail to me the treatment which he had 
experienced from Annette, and from what he said, it appeared that
her conduct to him had been in the highest degree reprehensible; 
notwithstanding he had indulged her in everything, she was never 
civil to him, but loaded him continually with taunts and insults,
and had finally, on his being unable to supply her with a sum of 
money which she had demanded, decamped from the lodgings which he
had taken for her, carrying with her all the presents which at 
various times he had bestowed upon her, and had put herself under
the protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the 
Italian Opera, at which place it appeared that her sister had 
lately been engaged as a danseuse.&nbsp; My friend informed me 
that at first he had experienced great agony at the ingratitude 
of Annette, but at last had made up his mind to forget her, and 
in order more effectually to do so, had left London with the 
intention of witnessing a fight, which was shortly coming off at 
a town in these parts, between some dogs and a lion; which 
combat, he informed me, had for some time past been looked 
forward to with intense eagerness by the gentlemen of the 
sporting world.</p>
<p>I commended him for his resolution, at the same time advising 
him not to give up his mind entirely to dog-fighting, as he had 
formerly done, but, when the present combat should be over, to 
return to his rhetorical studies, and above all to marry some 
rich and handsome lady on the first opportunity, as, with his 
person and expectations, he had only to sue for <!-- page 
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
157</span>the hand of the daughter of a marquis to be successful,
telling him with a sigh, that all women were not Annettes, and 
that upon the whole there was nothing like them.&nbsp; To which 
advice he answered, that he intended to return to rhetoric as 
soon as the lion-fight should be over, but that he never intended
to marry, having had enough of women; adding, that he was glad he
had no sister, as, with the feelings which he entertained with 
respect to her sex, he should be unable to treat her with common 
affection, and concluded by repeating a proverb which he had 
learned from an Arab whom he had met at Venice, to the effect 
that &ldquo;one who has been stung by a snake, shivers at the 
sight of a string.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little more conversation, we strolled to the stable, 
where my horse was standing; my friend, who was a Connoisseur in 
horse-flesh, surveyed the animal with attention, and after 
inquiring where and how I had obtained him, asked what I intended
to do with him; on my telling him that I was undetermined, and 
that I was afraid the horse was likely to prove a burden to me, 
he said, &ldquo;It is a noble animal, and if you mind what you 
are about, you may make a small fortune by him.&nbsp; I do not 
want such an animal myself, nor do I know any one who does; but a
great horse fair will be held shortly at a place where, it is 
true, I have never been, but of which I have heard a great deal 
from my acquaintances, where it is said a first-rate horse is 
always sure to fetch its value; that place is Horncastle, in 
Lincolnshire; you should take him thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis Ardry and myself dined together, and after dinner 
partook of a bottle of the best port which the inn 
afforded.&nbsp; After a few glasses, we had a great deal of 
conversation: I again brought the subject of marriage and love, 
divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis almost immediately 
begged me to drop it; and on my having the delicacy to comply, he
reverted to dog-fighting, on which he talked well and learnedly; 
amongst other things, he said that it was a princely sport of 
great antiquity, and quoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that 
the princes of India must have been of the fancy, they having, 
according to that author, treated Alexander to a fight between 
certain dogs and a lion.&nbsp; Becoming, notwithstanding my 
friend&rsquo;s eloquence and learning, somewhat tired of the 
subject, I began to talk about Alexander.&nbsp; Francis Ardry 
said he was one of the two great men whom the world has produced,
the other being Napoleon: I replied that I believed Tamerlane 
<!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
158</span>was a greater man than either; but Francis Ardry knew 
nothing of Tamerlane, save what he had gathered from the play of 
Timour the Tartar.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; 
&ldquo;Alexander and Napoleon are the great men of the world, 
their names are known everywhere.&nbsp; Alexander has been dead 
upwards of two thousand years, but the very English bumpkins 
sometimes christen their boys by the name of Alexander&mdash;can 
there be a greater evidence of his greatness?&nbsp; As for 
Napoleon, there are some parts of India in which his bust is 
worshipped.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wishing to make up a triumvirate, I 
mentioned the name of Wellington, to which Francis Ardry merely 
said, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; and resumed the subject of 
dog-fighting.</p>
<p>Francis Ardry remained at the inn during that day and the 
next, and then departed to the dog and lion fight; I never saw 
him afterwards, and merely heard of him once after a lapse of 
some years, and what I then heard was not exactly what I could 
have wished to hear.&nbsp; He did not make much of the advantages
which he possessed, a pity, for how great were those 
advantages,&mdash;person, intellect, eloquence, connection, 
riches! yet, with all these advantages, one thing highly needful 
seems to have been wanting in Francis.&nbsp; A desire, a craving,
to perform something great and good.&nbsp; Oh! what a vast deal 
may be done with intellect, courage, riches, accompanied by the 
desire of doing something great and good!&nbsp; Why, a person may
carry the blessings of civilisation and religion to barbarous, 
yet at the same time beautiful and romantic lands; and what a 
triumph there is for him who does so! what a crown of glory! of 
far greater value than those surrounding the brows of your mere 
conquerors.&nbsp; Yet who has done so in these times?&nbsp; Not 
many; not three, not two, something seems to have been always 
wanting; there is, however, one instance, in which the various 
requisites have been united, and the crown, the most desirable in
the world&mdash;at least which I consider to be the most 
desirable&mdash;achieved, and only one, that of Brooke of 
Borneo.</p>

<p>MR. PLATITUDE AND THE MAN IN BLACK&mdash;THE 
POSTILLION&rsquo;S ADVENTURES&mdash;THE LONE HOUSE&mdash;A GOODLY
ASSEMBLAGE.</p>
<p>It never rains, but it pours.&nbsp; I was destined to see at 
this inn more acquaintances than one.&nbsp; On the day of Francis
Ardry&rsquo;s departure, shortly after he had taken leave of me, 
as I was standing in the corn-chamber at a kind of writing-table 
or desk, fastened to the wall, with a book before me, in which I 
was making out an account of the corn and hay lately received and
distributed, my friend the postillion came running in out of 
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here they both are,&rdquo; he gasped out; 
&ldquo;pray do come and look at them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that red-haired Jack Priest, and that idiotic 
parson, Platitude; they have just been set down by one of the 
coaches, and want a post-chaise to go across the country in; and 
what do you think?&nbsp; I am to have the driving of them.&nbsp; 
I have no time to lose, for I must get myself ready; so do come 
and look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hastened into the yard of the inn; two or three of the 
helpers of our establishment were employed in drawing forward a 
post-chaise out of the chaise-house, which occupied one side of 
the yard, and which was spacious enough to contain nearly twenty 
of these vehicles, though it was never full, several of them 
being always out upon the roads, as the demand upon us for 
post-chaises across the country was very great.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There they are,&rdquo; said the postillion, softly, 
nodding towards two individuals, in one of whom I recognized the 
man in black, and in the other Mr. Platitude; &ldquo;there they 
are; have a good look at them, while I go and get 
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man in black and Mr. Platitude were 
walking up and down the yard, Mr. Platitude was doing his best to
make himself appear ridiculous, talking very loudly in 
exceedingly bad Italian, evidently for the purpose of attracting 
the notice of the bystanders, in which he succeeded, all the 
stable-boys and bystanders, in which he attracted by his 
vociferation, grinning at his ridiculous figure as he limped up 
and down.&nbsp; The man in black said little or nothing, but from
the glances which he cast sideways appeared to be thoroughly 
ashamed of his companion; the worthy <!-- page 160--><a 
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>couple 
presently arrived close to where I was standing, and the man in 
black, who was nearest to me, perceiving me, stood still as if 
hesitating, but recovering himself in a moment, he moved on 
without taking any further notice; Mr. Platitude exclaimed as 
they passed, in broken lingo, &ldquo;I hope we shall find the 
holy doctors all assembled,&rdquo; and as they returned, &ldquo;I
make no doubt that they will all be rejoiced to see 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to be standing an idle gazer, I went
to the chaise and assisted in attaching the horses, which had now
been brought out, to the pole.&nbsp; The postillion presently 
arrived, and finding all ready took the reins and mounted the 
box, whilst I very politely opened the door for the two 
travellers; Mr. Platitude got in first, and, without taking any 
notice of me, seated himself on the farther side.&nbsp; In got 
the man in black, and seated himself nearest to me.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;All is right,&rdquo; said I, as I shut the door, whereupon
the postillion cracked his whip, and the chaise drove out of the 
yard.&nbsp; Just as I shut the door, however, and just as Mr. 
Platitude had recommenced talking in jergo, at the top of his 
voice, the man in black turned his face partly towards me, and 
gave me a wink with his left eye.</p>
<p>I did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning, 
when he gave me an account of the adventures he had met with on 
his expedition.&nbsp; It appeared that he had driven the man in 
black and the Reverend Platitude across the country by roads and 
lanes which he had some difficulty in threading.&nbsp; At length,
when he had reached a part of the country where he had never been
before, the man in black pointed out to him a house near the 
corner of a wood, to which he informed him they were bound.&nbsp;
The postillion said it was a strange-looking house, with a wall 
round it; and, upon the whole, bore something of the look of a 
madhouse.&nbsp; There was already a post-chaise at the gate, from
which three individuals had alighted&mdash;one of them the 
postillion said was a mean-looking scoundrel, with a regular 
petty-larceny expression in his countenance.&nbsp; He was dressed
very much like the man in black, and the postillion said that he 
could almost have taken his bible oath that they were both of the
same profession.&nbsp; The other two he said were parsons, he 
could swear that, though he had never seen them before; there 
could be no mistake about them.&nbsp; Church of England parsons 
the postillion swore they were, with their black coats, white 
cravats, and airs, in which clumsiness and conceit were most 
funnily <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>blended&mdash;Church of England 
parsons of the Platitude description, who had been in Italy, and 
seen the Pope, and kissed his toe, and picked up a little broken 
Italian, and come home greater fools than they went forth.&nbsp; 
It appeared that they were all acquaintances of Mr. Platitude, 
for when the postillion had alighted and let Mr. Platitude and 
his companion out of the chaise, Mr. Platitude shook the whole 
three by the hand, conversed with his two brothers in a little 
broken jergo, and addressed the petty-larceny looking individual 
by the title of Reverend Doctor.&nbsp; In the midst of these 
greetings, however, the postillion said the man in black came up 
to him and proceeded to settle with him for the chaise; he had 
shaken hands with nobody, and had merely nodded to the others; 
&ldquo;and now,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;he evidently 
wished to get rid of me, fearing, probably, that I should see too
much of the nonsense that was going on.&nbsp; It was whilst 
settling with me that he seemed to recognise me for the first 
time, for he stared hard at me, and at last asked whether I had 
not been in Italy; to which question, with a nod and a laugh, I 
replied that I had.&nbsp; I was then going to ask him about the 
health of the image of Holy Mary, and to say that I hoped it had 
recovered from its horsewhipping; but he interrupted me, paid me 
the money for the fare, and gave me a crown for myself, saying he
would not detain me any longer.&nbsp; I say, partner, I am a poor
postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a good mind to 
fling it in his face.&nbsp; I reflected, however, that it was not
mere gift-money, but coin which I had earned, and hardly too, so 
I put it in my pocket, and I bethought me, moreover, that, knave 
as I knew him to be, he had always treated me with civility; so I
nodded to him, and he said something which perhaps he meant for 
Latin, but which sounded very much like &lsquo;vails,&rsquo; and 
by which he doubtless alluded to the money which he had given 
me.&nbsp; He then went into the house with the rest, the coach 
drove away which had brought the others, and I was about to get 
on the box and follow; observing, however, two more chaises 
driving up, I thought I would be in no hurry, so I just led my 
horses and chaise a little out of the way, and pretending to be 
occupied about the harness, I kept a tolerably sharp look-out at 
the new arrivals.&nbsp; Well, partner, the next vehicle that 
drove up was a gentleman&rsquo;s carriage which I knew very well,
as well as those within it, who were a father and son, the father
a good kind of old gentleman, and a justice of the <!-- page 
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>peace, therefore not very wise, as you may suppose; the
son a puppy who has been abroad, where he contrived to forget his
own language, though only nine months absent, and now rules the 
roast over his father and mother, whose only child he is, and by 
whom he is thought wondrous clever.&nbsp; So this foreigneering 
chap brings his poor old father to this out-of-the-way house to 
meet these Platitudes and petty-larceny villains, and perhaps 
would have brought his mother too, only, simple thing, by good 
fortune she happens to be laid up with the rheumatiz.&nbsp; Well,
the father and son, I beg pardon I mean the son and father, got 
down and went in, and then after their carriage was gone, the 
chaise behind drove up, in which was a huge fat fellow, weighing 
twenty stone at least, but with something of a foreign look, and 
with him&mdash;who do you think?&nbsp; Why, a rascally Unitarian 
minister, that is, a fellow who had been such a minister, but who
some years ago leaving his own people, who had bred him up and 
sent him to their college at York, went over to the High Church, 
and is now, I suppose, going over to some other church, for he 
was talking, as he got down, wondrous fast in Latin, or what 
sounded something like Latin, to the fat fellow, who appeared to 
take things wonderfully easy, and merely grunted to the dog Latin
which the scoundrel had learned at the expense of the poor 
Unitarians at York.&nbsp; So they went into the house, and 
presently arrived another chaise, but ere I could make any 
further observations, the porter of the out-of-the-way house came
up to me, asking what I was stopping there for? bidding me go 
away, and not pry into other people&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Pretty business,&rsquo; said I to him, &lsquo;that is 
being transacted in a place like this,&rsquo; and then I was 
going to say something uncivil, but he went to attend to the 
new-comers, and I took myself away on my own business as he bade 
me, not, however, before observing that these two last were a 
couple of blackcoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best 
of his way to a small public-house, about a mile off, where he 
had intended to bait, and how he met on the way a landau and pair
belonging to a Scotch coxcomb whom he had known in London, about 
whom he related some curious particulars, and then continued: 
&ldquo;Well, after I had passed him and his turn-out, I drove 
straight to the public-house, where I baited my horses, and where
I found some of the chaises and drivers who had driven the folks 
to the lunatic-looking mansion, and <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>were now 
waiting to take them up again.&nbsp; Whilst my horses were eating
their bait, I sat me down, as the weather was warm, at a table 
outside, and smoked a pipe, and drank some ale in company with 
the coachman of the old gentleman who had gone to the house with 
his son, and the coachman then told me that the house was a 
Papist house, and that the present was a grand meeting of all the
fools and rascals in the country, who came to bow down to images,
and to concert schemes&mdash;pretty schemes, no doubt&mdash;for 
overturning the religion of the country, and that for his part he
did not approve of being concerned with such doings, and that he 
was going to give his master warning next day.&nbsp; So, as we 
were drinking and discoursing, up drove the chariot of the 
Scotchman, and down got his valet and the driver, and whilst the 
driver was seeing after the horses, the valet came and sat down 
at the table where the gentleman&rsquo;s coachman and I were 
drinking.&nbsp; I knew the fellow well, a Scotchman like his 
master, and just of the same kidney, with white kid gloves, red 
hair frizzled, a patch of paint on his face, and his hands 
covered with rings.&nbsp; This very fellow, I must tell you, was 
one of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of 
the servants&rsquo; club in Park Lane, because I happened to 
serve a literary man; so he sat down, and in a kind of affected 
tone cried out, &lsquo;Landlord, bring me a glass of cold 
negus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The landlord, however, told him that there 
was no negus, but that, if he pleased, he could have a jug of as 
good beer as any in the country.&nbsp; &lsquo;Confound the 
beer,&rsquo; said the valet, &lsquo;do you think I am accustomed 
to such vulgar beverage?&rsquo;&nbsp; However, as he found there 
was nothing better to be had, he let the man bring him some beer,
and when he had got it, soon showed that he could drink it easily
enough; so, when he had drank two or three draughts, he turned 
his eyes in a contemptuous manner, first on the coachman, and 
then on me: I saw the scamp recollected me, for after staring at 
me and my dress for about half a minute, he put on a broad grin, 
and flinging his head back, he uttered a loud laugh.&nbsp; Well, 
I did not like this, as you may well believe, and taking the pipe
out of my mouth, I asked him if he meant anything personal, to 
which he answered, that he had said nothing to me, and that he 
had a right to look where he pleased, and laugh when he 
pleased.&nbsp; Well, as to a certain extent he was right, as to 
looking and laughing; and as I have occasionally looked at a fool
and laughed, though I was not the fool in this <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>instance, I
put my pipe into my mouth and said no more.&nbsp; This quiet and 
well-regulated behaviour of mine, however, the fellow interpreted
into fear; so, after drinking a little more, he suddenly started 
up, and striding once or twice before the table, he asked me what
I meant by that impertinent question of mine, saying that he had 
a good mind to wring my nose for my presumption.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have?&rsquo; said I, getting up and laying down my pipe, 
&lsquo;well, I&rsquo;ll now give you an opportunity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So I put myself in an attitude, and went up to him, saying, 
&lsquo;I have an old score to settle with you, you scamp; you 
wanted to get me turned out of the club, didn&rsquo;t 
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, remembering that he had 
threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter upon his 
own.&nbsp; I wish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the
smart; so far from trying to defend himself, he turned round, and
with his hand to his face, attempted to run away, but I was now 
in a regular passion, and following him up, got before him, and 
was going to pummel away at him, when he burst into tears, and 
begged me not to hurt him, saying that he was sorry if he had 
offended me, and that, if I pleased, he would go down on his 
knees, or do anything else I wanted.&nbsp; Well, when I heard him
talk in this manner, I of course let him be; I could hardly help 
laughing at the figure he cut; his face all blubbered with tears 
and blood and paint; but I did not laugh at the poor creature 
either, but went to the table and took up my pipe, and smoked and
drank as if nothing had happened; and the fellow, after having 
been to the pump, came and sat down, crying, and trying to curry 
favour with me and the coachman; presently, however, putting on a
confidential look, he began to talk of the Popish house, and of 
the doings there, and said he supposed as how we were of the 
party, and that it was all right; and then he began to talk of 
the Pope of Rome, and what a nice man he was, and what a fine 
thing it was to be of his religion, especially if folks went over
to him; and how it advanced them in the world, and gave them 
consideration; and how his master, who had been abroad and seen 
the Pope, and kissed his toe, was going over to the Popish 
religion, and had persuaded him to consent to do so, and to 
forsake his own, which I think the scoundrel called the 
&rsquo;Piscopal Church of Scotland, and how many others of that 
church were going over, thinking to better their condition in 
life by so doing, and to be more thought on; and how many of the 
English church <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>were thinking of going over 
too&mdash;and that he had no doubt that it would all end right 
and comfortably.&nbsp; Well, as he was going on in this way, the 
old coachman began to spit, and getting up, flung all the beer 
that was in his jug upon the ground, and going away, ordered 
another jug of beer, and sat down at another table, saying that 
he would not drink in such company; and I too got up, and flung 
what beer remained in my jug, there wasn&rsquo;t more than a 
drop, in the fellow&rsquo;s face, saying I would scorn to drink 
any more in such company; and then I went to my horses, put them 
to, paid my reckoning, and drove home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion having related his story, to which I listened 
with all due attention, mused for a moment, and then said, 
&ldquo;I dare say you remember how, some time since, when old 
Bill had been telling us how the Government, a long time ago, had
done away with robbing on the highway, by putting down the 
public-houses and places which the highwaymen frequented, and by 
sending out a good mounted police to hunt them down, I said that 
it was a shame that the present Government did not employ 
somewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of Mumbo
Jumbo and his gang nowadays in England.&nbsp; Howsomever, since I
have driven a fare to a Popish rendezvous, and seen something of 
what is going on there, I should conceive that the Government are
justified in allowing the gang the free exercise of their 
calling.&nbsp; Anybody is welcome to stoop and pick up nothing, 
or worse than nothing, and if Mumbo Jumbo&rsquo;s people, after 
their expeditions, return to their haunts with no better plunder 
in the shape of converts than what I saw going into yonder place 
of call, I should say they are welcome to what they get; for if 
that&rsquo;s the kind of rubbish they steal out of the Church of 
England, or any other church, who in his senses but would say a 
good riddance, and many thanks for your trouble: at any rate that
is my opinion of the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DELIBERATIONS WITH SELF&mdash;RESOLUTION&mdash;INVITATION TO 
DINNER&mdash;THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER&mdash;THE LANDLORD&rsquo;S 
OFFER&mdash;THE COMET WINE.</p>
<p>It was now that I had frequent deliberations with 
myself.&nbsp; Should I continue at the inn in my present 
position?&nbsp; I was not very much captivated with it; there was
little poetry in keeping an account of the corn, hay, and straw 
which came in, and was given out, and I was fond of poetry; 
moreover, there was no glory at all to be expected in doing so, 
and I was fond of glory.&nbsp; Should I give up that situation, 
and remaining at the inn, become ostler under old Bill?&nbsp; 
There was more poetry in rubbing down horses than in keeping an 
account of straw, hay, and corn; there was also some prospect of 
glory attached to the situation of ostler, for the grooms and 
stable-boys occasionally talked of an ostler, a great way down 
the road, who had been presented by some sporting people, not 
with a silver vase, as our governor had been, but with a silver 
currycomb, in testimony of their admiration for his skill; but I 
confess that the poetry of rubbing down had become, as all other 
poetry becomes, rather prosy by frequent repetition, and with 
respect to the chance of deriving glory from the employment, I 
entertained, in the event of my determining to stay, very slight 
hope of ever attaining skill in the ostler art sufficient to 
induce sporting people to bestow upon me a silver 
currycomb.&nbsp; I was not half so good an ostler as old Bill, 
who had never been presented with a silver currycomb, and I never
expected to become so, therefore what chance had I?&nbsp; It was 
true, there was a prospect of some pecuniary emolument to be 
derived by remaining in either situation.&nbsp; It was very 
probable that, provided I continued to keep an account of the hay
and corn coming in and expended, the landlord would consent to 
allow me a pound a week, which at the end of a dozen years, 
provided I kept myself sober, would amount to a considerable 
sum.&nbsp; I might, on the retirement of old Bill, by taking his 
place, save up a decent sum of money, provided, unlike him, I 
kept myself sober, and laid by all the shillings and sixpences I 
got; but the prospect of laying up a decent sum of money was not 
of sufficient importance to induce me to continue either at <!-- 
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
167</span>my wooden desk or in the inn-yard.&nbsp; The reader 
will remember what difficulty I had to make up my mind to become 
a merchant under the Armenian&rsquo;s auspices, even with the 
prospect of making two or three hundred thousand pounds by 
following the Armenian way of doing business, so it was not 
probable that I should feel disposed to be book-keeper or ostler 
all my life with no other prospect than being able to make a tidy
sum of money.&nbsp; If indeed, besides the prospect of making a 
tidy sum at the end of perhaps forty years ostlering, I had been 
certain of being presented with a silver currycomb with my name 
engraved upon it, which I might have left to my descendants, or, 
in default thereof, to the parish church destined to contain my 
bones, with directions that it might be soldered into the wall 
above the arch leading from the body of the church into the 
chancel&mdash;I will not say that with such a certainty of 
immortality, combined with such a prospect of moderate pecuniary 
advantage, I might not have thought it worth my while to stay, 
but I entertained no such certainty, and taking everything into 
consideration, I determined to mount my horse and leave the 
inn.</p>
<p>This horse had caused me for some time past no little 
perplexity; I had frequently repented of having purchased him, 
more especially as the purchase had been made with another 
person&rsquo;s money, and had more than once shown him to people 
who, I imagined, were likely to purchase him; but, though they 
were profuse in his praise, as people generally are in the praise
of what they don&rsquo;t intend to purchase, they never made me 
an offer, and now that I had determined to mount on his back and 
ride away, what was I to do with him in the sequel?&nbsp; I could
not maintain him long.&nbsp; Suddenly I bethought me of 
Horncastle, which Francis Ardry had mentioned as a place where 
the horse was likely to find a purchaser, and not having 
determined upon any particular place to which to repair, I 
thought that I could do no better than betake myself to 
Horncastle in the first instance, and there endeavour to dispose 
of my horse.</p>
<p>On making inquiries with respect to the situation of 
Horncastle, and the time when the fair would be held, I learned 
that the town was situated in Lincolnshire, about a hundred and 
fifty miles from the inn at which I was at present sojourning, 
and that the fair would be held nominally within about a month, 
but that it was always requisite to be on the spot some <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
168</span>days before the nominal day of the fair, as all the 
best horses were generally sold before that time, and the people 
who came to purchase gone away with what they had bought.</p>
<p>The people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of my 
determination to depart.&nbsp; Old Bill told me that he had hoped
as how I had intended to settle down there, and to take his place
as ostler when he was fit for no more work, adding, that though I
did not know much of the business, yet he had no doubt but that I
might improve.&nbsp; My friend the postillion was particularly 
sorry, and taking me with him to the tap-room called for two 
pints of beer, to one of which he treated me; and whilst we were 
drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought of 
my going, but that he hoped I should think better of the 
matter.&nbsp; On my telling him that I must go, he said that he 
trusted I should put off my departure for three weeks, in order 
that I might be present at his marriage, the banns of which were 
just about to be published.&nbsp; He said that nothing would give
him greater pleasure than to see me dance a minuet with his wife 
after the marriage dinner; but I told him it was impossible that 
I should stay, my affairs imperatively calling me elsewhere; and 
that with respect to my dancing a minuet, such a thing was out of
the question, as I had never learned to dance.&nbsp; At which he 
said that he was exceedingly sorry, and finding me determined to 
go, wished me success in all my undertakings.</p>
<p>The master of the house, to whom, as in duty bound, I 
communicated my intention before I spoke of it to the servants, 
was, I make no doubt, very sorry, though he did not exactly tell 
me so.&nbsp; What he said was, that he had never expected that I 
should remain long there, as such a situation never appeared to 
him quite suitable to me, though I had been very diligent, and 
had given him perfect satisfaction.&nbsp; On his inquiring when I
intended to depart, I informed him next day, whereupon he begged 
that I would defer my departure till the next day but one, and do
him the favour of dining with him on the morrow.&nbsp; I informed
him that I should be only too happy.</p>
<p>On the following day at four o&rsquo;clock I dined with the 
landlord, in company with a commercial traveller.&nbsp; The 
dinner was good, though plain, consisting of boiled 
mackerel&mdash;rather a rarity in those parts at that 
time&mdash;with fennel sauce, a prime baron of roast beef after 
the mackerel, then a tart and noble <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Cheshire 
cheese; we had prime sherry at dinner, and whilst eating the 
cheese prime porter, that of Barclay, the only good porter in the
world.&nbsp; After the cloth was removed we had a bottle of very 
good port; and whilst partaking of the port I had an argument 
with the commercial traveller on the subject of the 
corn-laws.</p>
<p>The commercial traveller, having worsted me in the argument on
the subject of the corn-laws, got up in great glee, saying that 
he must order his gig, as business must be attended to.&nbsp; 
Before leaving the room, however, he shook me patronisingly by 
the hand, and said something to the master of the house, but in 
so low a tone that it escaped my ear.</p>
<p>No sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me
that his friend the traveller had just said that I was a 
confounded sensible young fellow, and not at all opinionated, a 
sentiment in which he himself perfectly agreed&mdash;then hemming
once or twice, he said that as I was going on a journey he hoped 
I was tolerably well provided with money, adding that travelling 
was rather expensive, especially on horseback, the manner in 
which he supposed, as I had a horse in the stable, I intended to 
travel.&nbsp; I told him that though I was not particularly well 
supplied with money, I had sufficient for the expenses of my 
journey, at the end of which I hoped to procure more.&nbsp; He 
then hemmed again, and said that since I had been at the inn I 
had rendered him a great deal of service in more ways than one, 
and that he could not think of permitting me to depart without 
making me some remuneration; then putting his hand into his 
waistcoat pocket he handed me a cheque for ten pounds, which he 
had prepared beforehand, the value of which he said I could 
receive at the next town, or that, if I wished it, any waiter in 
the house would cash it for me.&nbsp; I thanked him for his 
generosity in the best terms I could select, but, handing him 
back his cheque, I told him that I could not accept it, saying 
that, so far from his being my debtor, I believed myself to be 
indebted to him, as not only myself but my horse had been living 
at his house for several weeks.&nbsp; He replied, that as for my 
board at a house like his it amounted to nothing, and as for the 
little corn and hay which the horse had consumed it was of no 
consequence, and that he must insist upon my taking the 
cheque.&nbsp; But I again declined, telling him that doing so 
would be a violation <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of a rule which I had determined to 
follow, and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever 
compel me to break through&mdash;never to incur 
obligations.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;receiving 
this money will not be incurring an obligation, it is your 
due.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;I did not engage to serve you for money, nor will I take 
any from you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you will take it as a 
loan?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I
never borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the landlord,
smiling, &ldquo;you are different from all others that I am 
acquainted with.&nbsp; I never yet knew any one else who scrupled
to borrow and receive obligations; why, there are two baronets in
this neighbourhood who have borrowed money of me, ay, and who 
have never repaid what they borrowed; and there are a dozen 
squires who are under considerable obligations to me, who I dare 
say will never return them.&nbsp; Come, you need not be more 
scrupulous than your superiors&mdash;I mean in 
station.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every vessel must stand on its own 
bottom,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they take pleasure in receiving 
obligations, I take pleasure in being independent.&nbsp; Perhaps 
they are wise, and I am a fool, I know not, but one thing I am 
certain of, which is, that were I not independent I should be 
very unhappy: I should have no visions then.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Have you any relations?&rdquo; said the landlord, looking 
at me compassionately; &ldquo;excuse me, but I don&rsquo;t think 
you are exactly fit to take care of yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There you are mistaken,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I can take 
precious good care of myself; ay, and can drive a precious hard 
bargain when I have occasion, but driving bargains is a widely 
different thing from receiving gifts.&nbsp; I am going to take my
horse to Horncastle, and when there I shall endeavour to obtain 
his full value&mdash;ay, to the last penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horncastle!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I have 
heard of that place; you mustn&rsquo;t be dreaming visions when 
you get there, or they&rsquo;ll steal the horse from under 
you.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; said he, rising, &ldquo;I shall not press
you further on the subject of the cheque.&nbsp; I intend, 
however, to put you under an obligation to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
then rang the bell, and having ordered two fresh glasses to be 
brought, he went out and presently returned with a small pint 
bottle, which he uncorked with his own hand; then sitting down, 
he said, &ldquo;The wine that I bring here is port of eighteen 
hundred and eleven, the year of the comet, the best vintage on 
record; the wine which we have been drinking,&rdquo; he added, 
&ldquo;is good, but not to be compared with this, which I never 
sell, and <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>which I am chary of.&nbsp; When you 
have drunk some of it, I think you will own that I have conferred
an obligation upon you;&rdquo; he then filled the glasses, the 
wine which he poured out diffusing an aroma through the room; 
then motioning me to drink, he raised his own glass to his lips, 
saying, &ldquo;Come, friend, I drink to your success at 
Horncastle.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p>TRIUMPHAL DEPARTURE&mdash;NO SEASON LIKE YOUTH&mdash;EXTREME 
OLD AGE&mdash;BEAUTIFUL ENGLAND&mdash;THE RATCATCHER&mdash;A 
MISADVENTURE.</p>
<p>I departed from the inn much in the same fashion as I had come
to it, mounted on a splendid horse indifferently well 
caparisoned, with the small valise attached to my crupper, in 
which, besides the few things I had brought with me, was a small 
book of roads with a map, which had been presented to me by the 
landlord.&nbsp; I must not forget to state that I did not ride 
out of the yard, but that my horse was brought to me at the front
door by old Bill, who insisted upon doing so, and who refused a 
five-shilling piece which I offered him; and it will be as well 
to let the reader know that the landlord shook me by the hand as 
I mounted, and that the people attached to the inn, male and 
female&mdash;my friend the postillion at the head&mdash;assembled
before the house to see me off, and gave me three cheers as I 
rode away.&nbsp; Perhaps no person ever departed from an inn with
more <i>&eacute;clat</i> or better wishes; nobody looked at me 
askance, except two stage-coachmen who were loitering about, one 
of whom said to his companion, &ldquo;I say, Jim! twig his 
portmanteau! a regular Newmarket turn-out, by . . .!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the cool of the evening of a bright day&mdash;all 
the days of that summer were bright&mdash;that I departed.&nbsp; 
I felt at first rather melancholy at finding myself again 
launched into the wide world, and leaving the friends whom I had 
lately made behind me; but by occasionally trotting the horse, 
and occasionally singing a song of Romanvile, I had dispelled the
feeling of melancholy by the time I had proceeded three miles 
down the main road.&nbsp; It was at the end of these three miles,
just opposite a milestone, that I struck into a cross road.&nbsp;
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>After riding about seven miles, threading what are 
called, in postillion parlance, cross-country roads, I reached 
another high road, tending to the east, along which I proceeded 
for a mile or two, when coming to a small inn, about nine 
o&rsquo;clock, I halted and put up for the night.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning I proceeded on my journey, but 
fearing to gall the horse, I no longer rode him, but led him by 
the bridle, until I came to a town at the distance of about ten 
miles from the place where I had passed the night.&nbsp; Here I 
stayed during the heat of the day, more on the horse&rsquo;s 
account than my own, and towards evening resumed my journey, 
leading the animal by the bridle as before; and in this manner I 
proceeded for several days, travelling on an average from twenty 
to twenty-five miles a day, always leading the animal, except 
perhaps now and then of an evening, when, if I saw a good piece 
of road before me, I would mount and put the horse into a trot, 
which the creature seemed to enjoy as much as myself, showing his
satisfaction by snorting and neighing, whilst I gave utterance to
my own exhilaration by shouts, or by &ldquo;the chi she is kaulo 
she soves pr&eacute; lakie dumo,&rdquo; or by something else of 
the same kind in Romanvile.</p>
<p>On the whole, I journeyed along very pleasantly, certainly 
quite as pleasantly as I do at present, now that I am become a 
gentleman, and weigh sixteen stone, though some people would say 
that my present manner of travelling is much the most preferable,
riding as I now do, instead of leading my horse; receiving the 
homage of ostlers instead of their familiar nods; sitting down to
dinner in the parlour of the best inn I can find, instead of 
passing the brightest part of the day in the kitchen of a village
alehouse; carrying on my argument after dinner on the subject of 
the corn-laws with the best commercial gentlemen on the road, 
instead of being glad, whilst sipping a pint of beer, to get into
conversation with blind trampers, or maimed Abraham sailors, 
regaling themselves on half-pints at the said village 
hostelries.&nbsp; Many people will doubtless say that things have
altered wonderfully with me for the better, and they would say 
right, provided I possessed now what I then carried about with me
in my journeys&mdash;the spirit of youth.&nbsp; Youth is the only
season for enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of 
one&rsquo;s life are worth all the rest of the longest life of 
man, even though those five-and-twenty be spent in penury and 
contempt, and the rest in the possession of wealth, honours, 
respectability, <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>ay, and many of them in strength and
health, such as will enable one to ride forty miles before 
dinner, and over one&rsquo;s pint of port&mdash;for the best 
gentleman in the land should not drink a bottle&mdash;carry on 
one&rsquo;s argument, with gravity and decorum, with any 
commercial gentleman who, responsive to one&rsquo;s challenge, 
takes the part of common sense and humanity against 
&ldquo;protection&rdquo; and the lord of land.</p>
<p>Ah! there is nothing like youth&mdash;not that after-life is 
valueless.&nbsp; Even in extreme old age one may get on very 
well, provided we will but accept of the bounties of God.&nbsp; I
met the other day an old man, who asked me to drink.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am not thirsty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and will not drink
with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; said the old 
man, &ldquo;for I am this day one hundred years old; and you will
never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a man 
on his hundredth birthday.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I broke my word, and 
drank.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yours is a wonderful age,&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a long time to look back to the beginning 
of it,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;yet, upon the whole, I am 
not sorry to have lived it all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How have you 
passed your time?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;As well as I 
could,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;always enjoying a good 
thing when it came honestly within my reach; not forgetting to 
praise God for putting it there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose 
you were fond of a glass of good ale when you were 
young?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I
was; and so, thank God, I am still.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he drank off
a glass of ale.</p>
<p>On I went in my journey, traversing England from west to 
east&mdash;ascending and descending hills&mdash;crossing rivers 
by bridge and ferry&mdash;and passing over extensive 
plains.&nbsp; What a beautiful country is England!&nbsp; People 
run abroad to see beautiful countries, and leave their own behind
unknown, unnoticed&mdash;their own the most beautiful!&nbsp; And 
then, again, what a country for adventures! especially to those 
who travel it on foot, or on horseback.&nbsp; People run abroad 
in quest of adventures, and traverse Spain and Portugal on mule 
or on horseback; whereas there are ten times more adventures to 
be met with in England than in Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany
to boot.&nbsp; Witness the number of adventures narrated in the 
present book&mdash;a book entirely devoted to England.&nbsp; Why,
there is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of 
adventures, with the exception of the present one, and this is 
not yet terminated.</p>
<p>After traversing two or three counties, I reached the confines
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; During one particularly hot day 
I put up at a public-house, to which in the evening came a party 
of harvesters to make merry, who, finding me wandering about the 
house a stranger, invited me to partake of their ale; so I drank 
with the harvesters, who sang me songs about rural life, such 
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sitting in the swale; and listening to the 
swindle of the flail, as it sounds dub-a-dub on the corn, from 
the neighbouring barn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In requital for which I treated them with a song, not of 
Romanvile, but the song of &ldquo;Sivord and the horse 
Grayman.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remained with them till it was dark, 
having, after sunset, entered into deep discourse with a 
celebrated ratcatcher, who communicated to me the secrets of his 
trade, saying, amongst other things, &ldquo;When you see the rats
pouring out of their holes, and running up my hands and arms, 
it&rsquo;s not after me they comes, but after the oils I carries 
about me they comes;&rdquo; and who subsequently spoke in the 
most enthusiastic manner of his trade, saying that it was the 
best trade in the world, and most diverting, and that it was 
likely to last for ever; for whereas all other kinds of vermin 
were fast disappearing from England, rats were every day becoming
more abundant.&nbsp; I had quitted this good company, and having 
mounted my horse, was making my way towards a town at about six 
miles&rsquo; distance, at a swinging trot, my thoughts deeply 
engaged on what I had gathered from the ratcatcher, when all on a
sudden a light glared upon the horse&rsquo;s face, who purled 
round in great terror, and flung me out of the saddle, as from a 
sling, or with as much violence as the horse Grayman, in the 
ballad, flings Sivord the Snareswayne.&nbsp; I fell upon the 
ground&mdash;felt a kind of crashing about my neck&mdash;and 
forthwith became senseless.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p>NOVEL SITUATION&mdash;THE ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL&mdash;THE 
SURGEON&mdash;A KIND OFFER&mdash;CHIMERICAL IDEAS&mdash;STRANGE 
DREAM.</p>
<p>How long I remained senseless I cannot say, for a considerable
time I believe; at length, opening my eyes, I found myself lying 
on a bed in a middle-sized chamber, lighted by a candle, <!-- 
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>which stood on a table&mdash;an elderly man stood near 
me, and a yet more elderly female was holding a phial of very 
pungent salts to my olfactory organ.&nbsp; I attempted to move, 
but felt very stiff&mdash;my right arm appeared nearly paralysed,
and there was a strange dull sensation in my head.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You had better remain still, young man,&rdquo; said the 
elderly individual, &ldquo;the surgeon will be here presently; I 
have sent a message for him to the neighbouring 
village.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and what has happened?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in my 
house,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and you have been flung 
from a horse.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that I was the cause.&nbsp;
As I was driving home, the lights in my gig frightened the 
animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the horse?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Below, in my stable,&rdquo; said the elderly 
individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw you fall, but knowing that on 
account of my age I could be of little use to you, I instantly 
hurried home, the accident did not occur more than a furlong off,
and procuring the assistance of my lad, and two or three 
neighbouring cottagers, I returned to the spot where you were 
lying senseless.&nbsp; We raised you up, and brought you 
here.&nbsp; My lad then went in quest of the horse, who had run 
away as we drew nigh.&nbsp; When we saw him first, he was 
standing near you; he caught him with some difficulty, and 
brought him home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you about?&rdquo; 
said the old man, as I strove to get off the bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
want to see the horse,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I entreat you 
to be still,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;the horse is safe, I
assure you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thinking about his 
knees,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead of thinking about your
horse&rsquo;s knees,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;be thankful 
that you have not broke your own neck.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do
not talk wisely,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;when a man&rsquo;s neck is
broke he is provided for; but when his horse&rsquo;s knees are 
broke he is a lost jockey, that is, if he has nothing but his 
horse to depend upon.&nbsp; A pretty figure I should cut at 
Horncastle, mounted on a horse blood-raw at the 
knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you are going to 
Horncastle,&rdquo; said the old man, seriously, &ldquo;then I can
sympathise with you in your anxiety about your horse, being a 
Lincolnshire man, and the son of one who bred horses.&nbsp; I 
will myself go down into the stable, and examine into the 
condition of your horse, so pray remain quiet till I return; it 
would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at Horncastle on a 
broken-kneed horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the room, and returned at the end of about ten 
minutes, followed by another person.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your horse is 
safe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and his knees are unblemished; not a
hair ruffled.&nbsp; <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>He is a fine animal, and will do 
credit to Horncastle; but here is the surgeon come to examine 
into your own condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The surgeon was a man about
thirty-five, thin, and rather tall; his face was long and pale, 
and his hair, which was light, was carefully combed back as much 
as possible from his forehead.&nbsp; He was dressed very neatly, 
and spoke in a very precise tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow me to feel 
your pulse, friend?&rdquo; said he, taking me by the right 
wrist.&nbsp; I uttered a cry, for at the motion which he caused a
thrill of agony darted through my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope your 
arm is not broke, my friend,&rdquo; said the surgeon, 
&ldquo;allow me to see; first of all, we must divest you of this 
cumbrous frock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frock was removed with some difficulty, and then the upper
vestments of my frame, with more difficulty still.&nbsp; The 
surgeon felt my arm, moving it up and down, causing me 
unspeakable pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no fracture,&rdquo; said 
he, at last, &ldquo;but a contusion&mdash;a violent 
contusion.&nbsp; I am told you were going to Horncastle; I am 
afraid you will be hardly able to ride your horse thither in time
to dispose of him; however, we shall see&mdash;your arm must be 
bandaged, friend; after which I will bleed you, and administer a 
composing draught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be short, the surgeon did as he proposed, and when he had 
administered the composing draught, he said, &ldquo;Be of good 
cheer; I should not be surprised if you are yet in time for 
Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then departed with the master of the 
house, and the woman, leaving me to my repose, I soon began to 
feel drowsy, and was just composing myself to slumber, lying on 
my back, as the surgeon had advised me, when I heard steps 
ascending the stairs, and in a moment more the surgeon entered 
again, followed by the master of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope 
we don&rsquo;t disturb you,&rdquo; said the former; &ldquo;my 
reason for returning is to relieve your mind from any anxiety 
with respect to your horse.&nbsp; I am by no means sure that you 
will be able, owing to your accident, to reach Horncastle in 
time: to quiet you, however, I will buy your horse for any 
reasonable sum.&nbsp; I have been down to the stable, and approve
of his figure.&nbsp; What do you want for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;This is a strange time of night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to 
come to me about purchasing my horse, and I am hardly in a 
fitting situation to be applied to about such a matter.&nbsp; 
What do you want him for?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For my own 
use,&rdquo; said the surgeon; &ldquo;I am a professional man, and
am obliged to be continually driving about; I cover at least one 
hundred and fifty miles every week.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will 
never answer your purpose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he is <!-- page 
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>not a driving horse, and was never between the shafts 
in his life; he is for riding, more especially for trotting, at 
which he has few equals.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It matters not to me
whether he is for riding or driving,&rdquo; said the surgeon, 
&ldquo;sometimes I ride, sometimes drive; so if we can come to 
terms, I will buy him, though remember it is chiefly to remove 
any anxiety from your mind about him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is
no time for bargaining,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you wish to have
the horse for a hundred guineas, you may; if not . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A hundred guineas,&rdquo; said the surgeon,
&ldquo;my good friend, you must surely be light-headed; allow me 
to feel your pulse,&rdquo; and he attempted to feel my left 
wrist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not light-headed,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and I require no one to feel my pulse; but I should be 
light-headed if I were to sell my horse for less than I have 
demanded; but I have a curiosity to know what you would be 
willing to offer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty pounds,&rdquo; said 
the surgeon, &ldquo;is all I can afford to give; and that is a 
great deal for a country surgeon to offer for a 
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty pounds,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;why he cost me nearly double that sum.&nbsp; To tell you 
the truth, I am afraid you want to take advantage of my 
situation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in the least, friend,&rdquo; 
said the surgeon, &ldquo;not in the least; I only wished to set 
your mind at rest about your horse; but as you think he is worth 
more than I can afford to offer, take him to Horncastle by all 
means; I will do my best to cure you in time.&nbsp; Good-night, I
will see you again on the morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he once 
more departed with the master of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sharp 
one,&rdquo; I heard him say, with a laugh, as the door closed 
upon him.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I again essayed to compose myself to rest, but
for some time in vain.&nbsp; I had been terribly shaken by my 
fall, and had subsequently, owing to the incision of the 
surgeon&rsquo;s lancet, been deprived of much of the vital fluid;
it is when the body is in such a state that the merest trifles 
affect and agitate the mind; no wonder, then, that the return of 
the surgeon and the master of the house for the purpose of 
inquiring whether I would sell my horse struck me as being highly
extraordinary, considering the hour of the night, and the 
situation in which they knew me to be.&nbsp; What could they mean
by such conduct&mdash;did they wish to cheat me of the 
animal?&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if they 
did, what matters, they found their match; yes, yes,&rdquo; said 
I, &ldquo;but I am in their power, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;but I 
instantly dismissed the apprehension which came into my mind with
a pooh, nonsense!&nbsp; In a little time, however, a far more 
foolish <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>and chimerical idea began to disturb
me&mdash;the idea of being flung from my horse; was I not 
disgraced for ever as a horseman by being flung from my 
horse?&nbsp; Assuredly, I thought; and the idea of being 
disgraced as a horseman, operating on my nervous system, caused 
me very acute misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said I to 
myself, &ldquo;it was perhaps the contemptible opinion which the 
surgeon must have formed of my equestrian powers, which induced 
him to offer to take my horse off my hands; he perhaps thought I 
was unable to manage a horse, and therefore in pity returned in 
the dead of night to offer to purchase the animal which had flung
me;&rdquo; and then the thought that the surgeon had conceived a 
contemptible opinion of my equestrian powers caused me the 
acutest misery, and continued tormenting me until some other idea
(I have forgot what it was, but doubtless equally foolish) took 
possession of my mind.&nbsp; At length, brought on by the 
agitation of my spirits, there came over me the same feeling of 
horror that I had experienced of old when I was a boy, and 
likewise of late within the dingle; it was, however, not so 
violent as it had been on those occasions, and I struggled 
manfully against it, until by degrees it passed away, and then I 
fell asleep; and in my sleep I had an ugly dream.&nbsp; I dreamt 
that I had died of the injuries I had received from my fall, and 
that no sooner had my soul departed from my body than it entered 
that of a quadruped, even my own horse in the stable&mdash;in a 
word, I was, to all intents and purposes, my own steed; and as I 
stood in the stable chewing hay (and I remember that the hay was 
exceedingly tough), the door opened, and the surgeon who had 
attended me came in.&nbsp; &ldquo;My good animal,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;as your late master has scarcely left enough to pay for 
the expenses of his funeral, and nothing to remunerate me for my 
trouble, I shall make bold to take possession of you.&nbsp; If 
your paces are good, I shall keep you for my own riding; if not, 
I shall take you to Horncastle, your original 
destination.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then bridled and saddled me, and, 
leading me out, mounted, and then trotted me up and down before 
the house, at the door of which the old man, who now appeared to 
be dressed in regular jockey fashion, was standing.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I like his paces well,&rdquo; said the surgeon; &ldquo;I 
think I shall take him for my own use.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
what am I to have for all the trouble his master caused 
me?&rdquo; said my late entertainer, on whose countenance I now 
observed, for the first time, a diabolical squint.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The consciousness of having done your duty to a 
fellow-creature in <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>succouring him in a time of 
distress, must be your reward,&rdquo; said the surgeon.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pretty gammon, truly,&rdquo; said my late entertainer; 
&ldquo;what would you say if I were to talk in that way to 
you?&nbsp; Come, unless you choose to behave jonnock, I shall 
take the bridle and lead the horse back into the 
stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the surgeon, 
&ldquo;we are old friends, and I don&rsquo;t wish to dispute with
you, so I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do: I will ride the 
animal to Horncastle, and we will share what he fetches like 
brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the old man, 
&ldquo;but if you say that you have sold him for less than a 
hundred, I shan&rsquo;t consider you jonnock; remember what the 
young fellow said&mdash;that young fellow . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; I 
heard no more, for the next moment I found myself on a broad road
leading, as I supposed, in the direction of Horncastle, the 
surgeon still in the saddle, and my legs moving at a rapid 
trot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; said the surgeon, jerking my 
mouth with the bit; whereupon, full of rage, I instantly set off 
at a full gallop, determined, if possible, to dash my rider to 
the earth.&nbsp; The surgeon, however, kept his seat, and, so far
from attempting to abate my speed, urged me on to greater efforts
with a stout stick, which methought he held in his hand.&nbsp; In
vain did I rear and kick, attempting to get rid of my foe; but 
the surgeon remained as saddle-fast as ever the Maugrabin 
sorcerer in the Arabian tale what time he rode the young prince 
transformed into a steed to his enchanted palace in the 
wilderness.&nbsp; At last, as I was still madly dashing on, 
panting and blowing, and had almost given up all hope, I saw at a
distance before me a heap of stones by the side of the road, 
probably placed there for the purpose of repairing it; a thought 
appeared to strike me&mdash;I will shy at those stones, and if I 
can&rsquo;t get rid of him so, resign myself to my fate.&nbsp; So
I increased my speed till arriving within about ten yards of the 
heap, I made a desperate start, turning half round with nearly 
the velocity of a mill-stone.&nbsp; Oh, the joy I experienced 
when I felt my enemy canted over my neck, and saw him lying 
senseless in the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have you now in my 
power,&rdquo; I said, or rather neighed, as, going up to my 
prostrate foe, I stood over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose I were to 
rear now, and let my fore feet fall upon you, what would your 
life be worth? that is, supposing you are not killed already, but
lie there, I will do you no further harm, but trot to Horncastle 
without a rider, and when there . . .&rdquo; and without further 
reflection off I trotted in the direction of Horncastle, but had 
not gone far before my bridle, falling from my neck, got <!-- 
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
180</span>entangled with my off fore foot.&nbsp; I felt myself 
falling, a thrill of agony shot through me&mdash;my knees would 
be broken, and what should I do at Horncastle with a pair of 
broken knees?&nbsp; I struggled, but I could not disengage my off
fore foot, and downward I fell, but before I had reached the 
ground I awoke, and found myself half out of bed, my bandaged arm
in considerable pain, and my left hand just touching the 
floor.</p>
<p>With some difficulty I readjusted myself in bed.&nbsp; It was 
now early morning, and the first rays of the sun were beginning 
to penetrate the white curtains of a window on my left, which 
probably looked into a garden, as I caught a glimpse or two of 
the leaves of trees through a small uncovered part at the 
side.&nbsp; For some time I felt uneasy and anxious, my spirits 
being in a strange fluttering state.&nbsp; At last my eyes fell 
upon a small row of tea-cups, seemingly of china, which stood on 
a mantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the bed.&nbsp; The 
sight of these objects, I know not why, soothed and pacified me; 
I kept my eyes fixed upon them, as I lay on my back on the bed, 
with my head upon the pillow, till at last I fell into a calm and
refreshing sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p>THE MORNING AFTER A FALL&mdash;THE TEAPOT&mdash;UNPRETENDING 
HOSPITALITY&mdash;THE CHINESE STUDENT.</p>
<p>It might be about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning when I 
was awakened by the entrance of the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;How 
have you rested?&rdquo; said he, coming up to the bedside and 
looking me in the face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and I feel much better, but I am still very 
sore.&rdquo;&nbsp; I surveyed him now for the first time with 
attention.&nbsp; He was dressed in a sober-coloured suit, and was
apparently between sixty and seventy.&nbsp; In stature he was 
rather above the middle height, but with a slight stoop, his 
features were placid, and expressive of much benevolence, but, as
it appeared to me, with rather a melancholy cast&mdash;as I gazed
upon them, I felt ashamed that I should ever have conceived in my
brain a vision like that of the preceding night, in which he 
appeared in so disadvantageous a light.&nbsp; At length he said, 
&ldquo;It is now time for you to take some refreshment.&nbsp; I 
hear my old servant <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>coming up with your 
breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a moment the elderly female entered 
with a tray, on which was some bread and butter, a teapot and 
cup.&nbsp; The cup was of common blue earthenware, but the pot 
was of china, curiously fashioned, and seemingly of great 
antiquity.&nbsp; The old man poured me out a cupful of tea, and 
then, with the assistance of the woman, raised me higher, and 
propped me up with pillows.&nbsp; I ate and drank; when the pot 
was emptied of its liquid (it did not contain much), I raised it 
up with my left hand to inspect it.&nbsp; The sides were covered 
with curious characters, seemingly hieroglyphics.&nbsp; After 
surveying them for some time, I replaced it upon the tray.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You seem fond of china,&rdquo; said I to the old man, 
after the servant had retired with the breakfast things, and I 
had returned to my former posture; &ldquo;you have china on the 
mantelpiece, and that was a remarkable teapot out of which I have
just been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man fixed his eyes intently on me, and methought the 
expression of his countenance became yet more melancholy.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;I am fond of 
china&mdash;I have reason to be fond of china&mdash;but for china
I should . . .&rdquo; and here he sighed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You value it for the quaintness and singularity of its 
form,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it appears to be less adapted for 
real use than our own pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care little about its form,&rdquo; said the old man; 
&ldquo;I care for it simply on account of . . . however, why talk
to you on a subject which can have no possible interest for 
you?&nbsp; I expect the surgeon here presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like that surgeon at all,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;how strangely he behaved last night, coming back, when I 
was just falling asleep, to ask me if I would sell my 
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has but one 
failing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an itch for horse-dealing; but 
for that he might be a much richer man than he is; he is 
continually buying and exchanging horses, and generally finds 
himself a loser by his bargains: but he is a worthy creature, and
skilful in his profession&mdash;it is well for you that you are 
under his care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man then left me, and in about an hour returned with 
the surgeon, who examined me and reported favourably as to my 
case.&nbsp; He spoke to me with kindness and feeling, and did not
introduce the subject of the horse.&nbsp; I asked him whether he 
thought I should be in time for the fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw some
people making their way thither to-day,&rdquo; said he; 
&ldquo;the <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>fair lasts three weeks, and it has 
just commenced.&nbsp; Yes, I think I may promise you that you 
will be in time for the very heat of it.&nbsp; In a few days you 
will be able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling, but 
you must by no means appear with your arm in a sling at 
Horncastle, as people would think that your horse had flung you, 
and that you wanted to dispose of him because he was a vicious 
brute.&nbsp; You must, by all means, drop the sling before you 
get to Horncastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three days I kept my apartment by the advice of the 
surgeon.&nbsp; I passed my time as I best could.&nbsp; Stretched 
on my bed, I either abandoned myself to reflection, or listened 
to the voices of the birds in the neighbouring garden.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, as I lay awake at night, I would endeavour to catch 
the tick of a clock, which methought sounded from some distant 
part of the house.</p>
<p>The old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire 
into my state.&nbsp; His words were few on these occasions, and 
he did not stay long.&nbsp; Yet his voice and his words were 
kind.&nbsp; What surprised me most in connection with this 
individual was the delicacy of conduct which he exhibited in not 
letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify 
curiosity respecting who I was, or whence I came.&nbsp; All he 
knew of me was, that I had been flung from my horse on my way to 
a fair for the purpose of disposing of the animal; and that I was
now his guest.&nbsp; I might be a common horse-dealer for what he
knew, yet I was treated by him with all the attention which I 
could have expected had I been an alderman of Boston&rsquo;s 
heir, and known to him as such.&nbsp; The county in which I am 
now, thought I at last, must be either extraordinarily devoted to
hospitality, or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary 
individual.&nbsp; On the evening of the fourth day, feeling tired
of my confinement, I put my clothes on in the best manner I 
could, and left the chamber.&nbsp; Descending a flight of stairs,
I reached a kind of quadrangle, from which branched two or three 
passages; one of these I entered, which had a door at the farther
end, and one on each side; the one to the left standing partly 
open, I entered it, and found myself in a middle-sized room with 
a large window, or rather glass-door, which looked into a garden,
and which stood open.&nbsp; There was nothing remarkable in this 
room, except a large quantity of china.&nbsp; There was china on 
the mantelpiece&mdash;china on two tables, and a small beaufet, 
which stood opposite <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the glass-door, was covered with 
china&mdash;there were cups, teapots, and vases of various forms,
and on all of them I observed characters&mdash;not a teapot, not 
a tea-cup, not a vase of whatever form or size, but appeared to 
possess hieroglyphics on some part or other.&nbsp; After 
surveying these articles for some time with no little interest, I
passed into the garden, in which there were small parterres of 
flowers, and two or three trees, and which, where the house did 
not abut, was bounded by a wall; turning to the right by a walk 
by the side of the house, I passed by a door&mdash;probably the 
one I had seen at the end of the passage&mdash;and arrived at 
another window similar to that through which I had come, and 
which also stood open; I was about to pass by it, when I heard 
the voice of my entertainer exclaiming, &ldquo;Is that you? pray 
come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I entered the room, which seemed to be a counterpart of the 
one which I had just left.&nbsp; It was of the same size, had the
same kind of furniture, and appeared to be equally well stocked 
with china; one prominent article it possessed, however, which 
the other room did not exhibit&mdash;namely, a clock, which, with
its pendulum moving tick-a-tick, hung against the wall opposite 
to the door, the sight of which made me conclude that the sound 
which methought I had heard in the stillness of the night was not
an imaginary one.&nbsp; There it hung on the wall, with its 
pendulum moving tick-a-tick.&nbsp; The old gentleman was seated 
in an easy-chair a little way into the room, having the 
glass-door on his right hand.&nbsp; On a table before him lay a 
large open volume, in which I observed Roman letters as well as 
characters.&nbsp; A few inches beyond the book on the table, 
covered all over with hieroglyphics, stood a china vase.&nbsp; 
The eyes of the old man were fixed upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said he, motioning me with his hand to
a stool close by, but without taking his eyes from the vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; said he, at last, 
removing his eyes from the vase, and leaning back on the chair; 
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assist me,&rdquo; said the old man, looking at me, with
a half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand
Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said the old man, with another 
slight smile; &ldquo;but&mdash;but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;I wished to ask you,&rdquo; said the old man, 
&ldquo;how you knew that the characters on yon piece of crockery 
were Chinese; or, indeed, that there was such a 
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the crockery was china,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to 
be Chinese; as for there being such a language&mdash;the English 
have a language, the French have a language, and why not the 
Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any language besides English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know a little of two or 
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask their names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know a little 
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little Welsh, and a little Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Haik?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you in my house,&rdquo; said the old 
man, shaking me by the hand; &ldquo;how singular that one coming 
as you did should know Armenian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more singular,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than that one 
living in such a place as this should know Chinese.&nbsp; How 
came you to acquire it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at me, and sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg 
pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for asking what is, perhaps, an 
impertinent question; I have not imitated your own delicacy; you 
have never asked me a question without first desiring permission,
and here I have been days and nights in your house an intruder on
your hospitality, and you have never so much as asked me who I 
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In forbearing to do that,&rdquo; said the old man, 
&ldquo;I merely obeyed the Chinese precept, &lsquo;Ask no 
questions of a guest;&rsquo; it is written on both sides of the 
teapot out of which you have had your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew Chinese,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is 
it a difficult language to acquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to think so,&rdquo; said the old 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been occupied upon it five-and-thirty 
years, and I am still very imperfectly acquainted with it; at 
least, I frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning 
of which to me is very dark, though it is true these sentences 
are mostly verses, which are, of course, more difficult to 
understand than mere prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Are your Chinese studies,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;confined to crockery literature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I read 
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the Chinese 
have no letters, but that for every word they have a separate 
character&mdash;is it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every word they have a particular character,&rdquo;
said the old man; &ldquo;though, to prevent confusion, they have 
arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we 
should call radicals, but which they call keys.&nbsp; As we 
arrange all our words in a dictionary under twenty-four letters, 
so do they arrange all their words, or characters, under two 
hundred and fourteen radical signs; the simplest radicals being 
the first, and the more complex the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the Chinese resemble any of the European languages
in words?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am scarcely competent to inform you,&rdquo; said the 
old man; &ldquo;but I believe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that character represent?&rdquo; said I, 
pointing to one on the vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A knife,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;that character
is one of the simplest radicals or keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the sound of it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tau,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tau!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;tau!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange word for a knife! is it not?&rdquo; said the 
old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawse!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;tawse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is tawse?&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never at school at Edinburgh, I 
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That accounts for your not knowing the meaning of 
tawse,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;had you received the rudiments of a 
classical education at the High School, you would have known the 
meaning of tawse full well.&nbsp; It is a leathern thong, with 
which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their duty by
the dominie, Tau&mdash;tause&mdash;how singular!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see what the two words have in common, except 
a slight agreement in sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see the connection,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when
I inform you that the thong, from the middle to the bottom, is 
cut or slit into two or three parts, from which slits or cuts, 
unless I am very much mistaken, it derives its name&mdash;tawse, 
a thong with <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>slits or cuts, used for chastising 
disorderly urchins at the High School, from the French tailler, 
to cut; evidently connected with the Chinese tau, a 
knife&mdash;how very extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p>CONVALESCENCE&mdash;THE SURGEON&rsquo;S BILL&mdash;LETTER OF 
RECOMMENDATION&mdash;COMMENCEMENT OF THE OLD MAN&rsquo;S 
HISTORY.</p>
<p>Two days&mdash;three days passed away&mdash;and I still 
remained at the house of my hospitable entertainer; my bruised 
limb rapidly recovering the power of performing its 
functions.&nbsp; I passed my time agreeably enough, sometimes in 
my chamber, communing with my own thoughts; sometimes in the 
stable, attending to, and not unfrequently conversing with, my 
horse; and at meal-time&mdash;for I seldom saw him at any 
other&mdash;discoursing with the old gentleman, sometimes on the 
Chinese vocabulary, sometimes on Chinese syntax, and once or 
twice on English horseflesh; though on this latter subject, 
notwithstanding his descent from a race of horse-traders, he did 
not enter with much alacrity.&nbsp; As a small requital for his 
kindness, I gave him one day, after dinner, unasked, a brief 
account of my history and pursuits.&nbsp; He listened with 
attention; and when it was concluded, thanked me for the 
confidence which I had reposed in him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such 
conduct,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;deserves a return.&nbsp; I will 
tell you my own history; it is brief, but may perhaps not prove 
uninteresting to you&mdash;though the relation of it will give me
some pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, then, do not recite 
it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, 
&ldquo;I will tell you, for I wish you to know it.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
He was about to begin, when he was interrupted by the arrival of 
the surgeon.&nbsp; The surgeon examined into the state of my 
bruised limb, and told me, what indeed I already well knew, that 
it was rapidly improving.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not even require 
a sling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to ride to Horncastle.&nbsp; When
do you propose going?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;When do 
you think I may venture?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think, 
if you are a tolerably good horseman, you may mount the day after
to-morrow,&rdquo; answered the medical man.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By-the-bye, are you acquainted with anybody at 
Horncastle?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With no living soul,&rdquo; I 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you would scarcely find stable-room 
<!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
187</span>for your horse.&nbsp; But I am happy to be able to 
assist you.&nbsp; I have a friend there who keeps a small inn, 
and who, during the time of the fair, keeps a stall vacant for 
any quadruped I may bring, until he knows whether I am coming or 
not.&nbsp; I will give you a letter to him, and he will see after
the accommodation of your horse.&nbsp; To-morrow I will pay you a
farewell visit, and bring you the letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and do not forget to 
bring your bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The surgeon looked at the old man, 
who gave him a peculiar nod.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, in 
reply to me, &ldquo;for the little service I have rendered you, I
require no remuneration.&nbsp; You are in my friend&rsquo;s 
house, and he and I understand each other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
never receive such favours,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as you have 
rendered me, without remunerating them; therefore I shall expect 
your bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! just as you please,&rdquo; 
said the surgeon; and shaking me by the hand more warmly than he 
had hitherto done, he took his leave.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day, the last which I spent with my
kind entertainer, I sat at tea with him in a little summer-house 
in his garden, partially shaded by the boughs of a large 
fig-tree.&nbsp; The surgeon had shortly before paid me his 
farewell visit, and had brought me the letter of introduction to 
his friend at Horncastle, and also his bill, which I found 
anything but extravagant.&nbsp; After we had each respectively 
drank the contents of two cups&mdash;and it may not be amiss here
to inform the reader that though I took cream with my tea, as I 
always do when I can procure that addition, the old man, like 
most people bred up in the country, drank his without it&mdash;he
thus addressed me:&mdash;&ldquo;I am, as I told you on the night 
of your accident, the son of a breeder of horses, a respectable 
and honest man.&nbsp; When I was about twenty he died, leaving 
me, his only child, a comfortable property, consisting of about 
two hundred acres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in 
money.&nbsp; My mother had died about three years 
previously.&nbsp; I felt the death of my mother keenly, but that 
of my father less than was my duty; indeed, truth compels me to 
acknowledge that I scarcely regretted his death.&nbsp; The cause 
of this want of proper filial feeling was the opposition which I 
had experienced from him in an affair which deeply concerned 
me.&nbsp; I had formed an attachment for a young female in the 
neighbourhood, who, though poor, was of highly respectable birth,
her father having been a curate of the Established Church.&nbsp; 
She was, at the time of which I am speaking, an <!-- page 
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
188</span>orphan, having lost both her parents, and supported 
herself by keeping a small school.&nbsp; My attachment was 
returned, and we had pledged our vows, but my father, who could 
not reconcile himself to her lack of fortune, forbade our 
marriage in the most positive terms.&nbsp; He was wrong, for she 
was a fortune in herself&mdash;amiable and accomplished.&nbsp; 
Oh! I cannot tell you all she was&rdquo;&mdash;and here the old 
man drew his hand across his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the death of 
my father, the only obstacle to our happiness appeared to be 
removed.&nbsp; We agreed, therefore, that our marriage should 
take place within the course of a year; and I forthwith commenced
enlarging my house and getting my affairs in order.&nbsp; Having 
been left in the easy circumstances which I have described, I 
determined to follow no business, but to pass my life in a 
strictly domestic manner, and to be very, very happy.&nbsp; 
Amongst other property derived from my father were several 
horses, which I disposed of in this neighbourhood, with the 
exception of two remarkably fine ones, which I determined to take
to the next fair at Horncastle, the only place where I expected 
to be able to obtain what I considered to be their full 
value.&nbsp; At length the time arrived for the commencement of 
the fair, which was within three months of the period which my 
beloved and myself had fixed upon for the celebration of our 
nuptials.&nbsp; To the fair I went, a couple of trusty men 
following me with the horses.&nbsp; I soon found a purchaser for 
the animals, a portly, plausible person, of about forty, dressed 
in a blue riding coat, brown top boots, and leather 
breeches.&nbsp; There was a strange-looking urchin with him, 
attired in nearly similar fashion, with a beam in one of his 
eyes, who called him father.&nbsp; The man paid me for the 
purchase in bank-notes&mdash;three fifty-pound notes for the two 
horses.&nbsp; As we were about to take leave of each other, he 
suddenly produced another fifty-pound note, inquiring whether I 
could change it, complaining, at the same time, of the difficulty
of procuring change in the fair.&nbsp; As I happened to have 
plenty of small money in my possession, and as I felt obliged to 
him for having purchased my horses at what I considered to be a 
good price, I informed him that I should be very happy to 
accommodate him; so I changed him the note, and he, having taken 
possession of the horses, went his way, and I myself returned 
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month passed; during this time I paid away two of the
notes which I had received at Horncastle from the 
dealer&mdash;<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>one of them in my immediate 
neighbourhood, and the other at a town about fifteen miles 
distant, to which I had repaired for the purpose of purchasing 
some furniture.&nbsp; All things seemed to be going on most 
prosperously, and I felt quite happy, when one morning, as I was 
overlooking some workmen who were employed about my house, I was 
accosted by a constable, who informed me that he was sent to 
request my immediate appearance before a neighbouring bench of 
magistrates.&nbsp; Concluding that I was merely summoned on some 
unimportant business connected with the neighbourhood, I felt no 
surprise, and forthwith departed in company with the 
officer.&nbsp; The demeanour of the man upon the way struck me as
somewhat singular.&nbsp; I had frequently spoken to him before, 
and had always found him civil and respectful, but he was now 
reserved and sullen, and replied to two or three questions which 
I put to him in anything but a courteous manner.&nbsp; On 
arriving at the place where the magistrates were sitting&mdash;an
inn at a small town about two miles distant&mdash;I found a more 
than usual number of people assembled, who appeared to be 
conversing with considerable eagerness.&nbsp; At sight of me they
became silent, but crowded after me as I followed the man into 
the magistrates&rsquo; room.&nbsp; There I found the tradesman to
whom I had paid the note for the furniture, at the town fifteen 
miles off, in attendance, accompanied by an agent of the Bank of 
England; the former, it seems, had paid the note into a 
provincial bank, the proprietors of which, discovering it to be a
forgery, had forthwith written up to the Bank of England, who had
sent down their agent to investigate the matter.&nbsp; A third 
individual stood beside them&mdash;the person in my own immediate
neighbourhood to whom I had paid the second note; this, by some 
means or other, before the coming down of the agent, had found 
its way to the same provincial bank, and also being pronounced a 
forgery, it had speedily been traced to the person to whom I had 
paid it.&nbsp; It was owing to the apparition of this second note
that the agent had determined, without further inquiry, to cause 
me to be summoned before the rural tribunal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few words the magistrates&rsquo; clerk gave me to 
understand the state of the case.&nbsp; I was filled with 
surprise and consternation.&nbsp; I knew myself to be perfectly 
innocent of any fraudulent intention, but at the time of which I 
am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest danger to 
be mixed up, how ever innocently, with the passing of false 
money.&nbsp; The law <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>with respect to forgery was terribly
severe, and the innocent as well as the guilty occasionally 
suffered.&nbsp; Of this I was not altogether ignorant; 
unfortunately, however, in my transactions with the stranger, the
idea of false notes being offered to me, and my being brought 
into trouble by means of them, never entered my mind.&nbsp; 
Recovering myself a little, I stated that the notes in question 
were two of three notes which I had received at Horncastle for a 
pair of horses, which it was well known I had carried 
thither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon I produced from my pocket-book the third 
note, which was forthwith pronounced a forgery.&nbsp; I had 
scarcely produced the third note when I remembered the one which 
I had changed for the Horncastle dealer, and with the remembrance
came the almost certain conviction that it was also a forgery; I 
was tempted for a moment to produce it, and to explain the 
circumstance&mdash;would to God I had done so!&mdash;but shame at
the idea of having been so wretchedly duped prevented me, and the
opportunity was lost.&nbsp; I must confess that the agent of the 
bank behaved, upon the whole, in a very handsome manner; he said 
that as it was quite evident that I had disposed of certain 
horses at the fair, it was very possible that I might have 
received the notes in question in exchange for them, and that he 
was willing, as he had received a very excellent account of my 
general conduct, to press the matter no farther, that is, 
provided . . .&nbsp; And here he stopped.&nbsp; Thereupon one of 
the three magistrates who were present asked me whether I chanced
to have any more of these spurious notes in my possession.&nbsp; 
He had certainly a right to ask the question, but there was 
something peculiar in his tone&mdash;insinuating suspicion.&nbsp;
It is certainly difficult to judge of the motives which rule a 
person&rsquo;s conduct, but I cannot help imagining that he was 
somewhat influenced in his behaviour on that occasion, which was 
anything but friendly, by my having refused to sell him the 
horses at a price less than that which I expected to get at the 
fair; be this as it may, the question filled me with 
embarrassment, and I bitterly repented not having at first been 
more explicit.&nbsp; Thereupon the magistrate, in the same kind 
of tone, demanded to see my pocket-book.&nbsp; I knew that to 
demur would be useless, and produced it, and forthwith amongst 
two or three country notes, appeared the fourth which I had 
received from the Horncastle dealer.&nbsp; The agent took it up 
and examined it with attention.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, is it a 
genuine note?&rsquo; <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>said the magistrate.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
am sorry to say that it is not,&rsquo; said the agent; &lsquo;it 
is a forgery, like the other three.&rsquo;&nbsp; The magistrate 
shrugged his shoulders, as indeed did several people in the 
room.&nbsp; &lsquo;A regular dealer in forged notes,&rsquo; said 
a person close behind me; &lsquo;who would have thought 
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing matters begin to look so serious, I aroused 
myself and endeavoured to speak in my own behalf, giving a candid
account of the manner in which I became possessed of the notes; 
but my explanation did not appear to meet much credit: the 
magistrate, to whom I have in particular alluded, asked why I had
not at once stated the fact of my having received a fourth note; 
and the agent, though in a very quiet tone observed that he could
not help thinking it somewhat strange that I should have changed 
a note of so much value for a perfect stranger, even supposing 
that he had purchased my horses, and had paid me their value in 
hard cash; and I noticed that he laid a particular emphasis on 
the last words.&nbsp; I might have observed that I was an 
inexperienced young man who meaning no harm myself, suspected 
none in others, but I was confused, stunned, and my tongue seemed
to cleave to the roof of my mouth.&nbsp; The men who had taken my
horses to Horncastle, and for whom I had sent, as they lived 
close at hand, now arrived, but the evidence which they could 
give was anything but conclusive in my favour; they had seen me 
in company with an individual at Horncastle, to whom by my orders
they had delivered certain horses, but they had seen no part of 
the money transaction; the fellow, whether from design or not, 
having taken me aside into a retired place, where he had paid me 
the three spurious notes, and induced me to change the fourth, 
which throughout the affair was what bore most materially against
me.&nbsp; How matters might have terminated I do not know; I 
might have been committed to prison, and I might have been . . 
.&nbsp; Just then, when I most needed a friend, and least 
expected to find one, for though amongst those present there were
several who were my neighbours, and who had professed friendship 
for me, none of them when they saw that I needed support and 
encouragement came forward to yield me any, but, on the contrary,
appeared by their looks to enjoy my terror and 
confusion&mdash;just then a friend entered the room in the person
of the surgeon of the neighbourhood, the father of him who has 
attended you; he was not on very intimate terms with me, but he 
had occasionally <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>spoken to me, and had attended my 
father in his dying illness, and chancing to hear that I was in 
trouble, he now hastened to assist me.&nbsp; After a short 
preamble, in which he apologised to the bench for interfering, he
begged to be informed of the state of the case, whereupon the 
matter was laid before him in all its details.&nbsp; He was not 
slow in taking a fair view of it, and spoke well and eloquently 
in my behalf&mdash;insisting on the improbability that a person 
of my habits and position would be wilfully mixed up with a 
transaction like that of which it appeared I was 
suspected&mdash;adding, that as he was fully convinced of my 
innocence, he was ready to enter into any surety with respect to 
my appearance at any time to answer anything which might be laid 
to my charge.&nbsp; This last observation had particular effect, 
and as he was a person universally respected, both for his skill 
in his profession and his general demeanour, people began to 
think that a person in whom he took an interest could scarcely be
concerned in anything criminal, and though my friend the 
magistrate&mdash;I call him so ironically&mdash;made two or three
demurs, it was at last agreed between him and his brethren of the
bench, that, for the present, I should be merely called upon to 
enter into my own recognisance for the sum of two hundred pounds,
to appear whenever it should be deemed requisite to enter into 
any farther investigation of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty
justice without handcuffs, and uncollared by a constable; but 
people looked coldly and suspiciously upon me.&nbsp; The first 
thing I did was to hasten to the house of my beloved, in order to
inform her of every circumstance attending the transaction.&nbsp;
I found her, but how?&nbsp; A malicious female individual had 
hurried to her with a distorted tale, to the effect that I had 
been taken up as an utterer of forged notes; that an immense 
number had been found in my possession; that I was already 
committed, and that probably I should be executed.&nbsp; My 
affianced one tenderly loved me, and her constitution was 
delicate; fit succeeded fit; she broke a blood-vessel, and I 
found her deluged in blood; the surgeon had just been sent for; 
he came and afforded her every possible relief.&nbsp; I was 
distracted; he bade me have hope, but I observed he looked very 
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the skill of the surgeon, the poor girl was saved in
the first instance from the arms of death, and for a few weeks 
she <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span

by degrees, however, she became melancholy; a worm preyed upon 
her spirit; a slow fever took possession of her frame.&nbsp; I 
subsequently learned that the same malicious female who had first
carried to her an exaggerated account of the affair, and who was 
a distant relative of her own, frequently visited her, and did 
all in her power to excite her fears with respect to its eventual
termination.&nbsp; Time passed on in a very wretched 
manner.&nbsp; Our friend the surgeon showing to us both every 
mark of kindness and attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was owing to this excellent man that my innocence 
was eventually established.&nbsp; Having been called to a town on
the borders of Yorkshire to a medical consultation, he chanced to
be taking a glass of wine with the landlord of the inn at which 
he stopped, when the waiter brought in a note to be changed, 
saying &lsquo;that the Quaker gentleman who had been for some 
days in the house, and was about to depart, had sent it to be 
changed, in order that he might pay his bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
landlord took the note, and looked at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
fifty-pound bill,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like 
changing bills of that amount, lest they should prove bad ones; 
however, as it comes from a Quaker gentleman, I suppose it is all
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mention of a fifty-pound note aroused the
attention of my friend, and he requested to be permitted to look 
at it; he had scarcely seen it, when he was convinced that it was
one of the same description as those which had brought me into 
trouble, as it corresponded with them in two particular features,
which the agent of the bank had pointed out to him and others as 
evidence of their spuriousness.&nbsp; My friend, without a 
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, informed the landlord that the note 
was a bad one, expressing at the time a great wish to see the 
Quaker gentleman who wanted to have it changed.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
you can easily do,&rsquo; said the landlord, and forthwith 
conducted him into the common room, where he saw a 
respectable-looking man, dressed like a Quaker, and seemingly 
about sixty years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, after a short apology, showed him the note 
which he held in his hand, stating that he had no doubt it was a 
spurious one, and begged to be informed where he had taken it, 
adding, that a particular friend of his was at present in 
trouble, owing to his having taken similar notes from a stranger 
at Horncastle; but that he hoped that he, the Quaker, could give 
information by means of which the guilty party or <!-- page 
194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>parties, could be arrested.&nbsp; At the mention of 
Horncastle, it appeared to my friend that the Quaker gave a 
slight start.&nbsp; At the conclusion of this speech, however, he
answered, with great tranquillity, that he had received it in the
way of business at . . .&mdash;naming one of the principal towns 
in Yorkshire&mdash;from a very respectable person, whose name he 
was perfectly willing to communicate, and likewise his own, which
he said was James, and that he was a merchant residing at 
Liverpool; that he would write to his friend at . . ., requesting
him to make inquiries on the subject; that just at that moment he
was in a hurry to depart, having some particular business at a 
town about ten miles off, to go to which he had bespoken a 
post-chaise of the landlord; that with respect to the note, it 
was doubtless a very disagreeable thing to have a suspicious one 
in his possession, but that it would make little difference to 
him, as he had plenty of other money, and thereupon he pulled out
a purse containing various other notes and some gold, observing 
&lsquo;that his only motive for wishing to change the other note 
was a desire to be well provided with change;&rsquo; and finally,
that if they had any suspicion with respect to him, he was 
perfectly willing to leave the note in their possession till he 
should return, which he intended to do in about a 
fortnight.&nbsp; There was so much plausibility in the speech of 
the Quaker, and his appearance and behaviour were so perfectly 
respectable, that my friend felt almost ashamed of the suspicion 
which at first he had entertained of him, though, at the same 
time, he felt an unaccountable unwillingness to let the man 
depart without some further interrogation.&nbsp; The landlord, 
however, who did not wish to disoblige one who had been, and 
might probably be again, a profitable customer, declared that he 
was perfectly satisfied; that he had no wish to detain the note, 
which he made no doubt the gentleman had received in the way of 
business, and that as the matter concerned him alone, he would 
leave it to him to make the necessary inquiries.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Just as you please, friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker, 
pocketing the suspicious note; &lsquo;I will now pay my 
bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he discharged the bill with a 
five-pound note, which he begged the landlord to inspect 
carefully, and with two pieces of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord had just taken the money, receipted the 
bill, and was bowing to his customer, when the door opened, and a
lad, dressed in a kind of grey livery, appeared, and informed the
Quaker that the chaise was ready.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that boy your 
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
195</span>servant?&rsquo; said the surgeon.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is, 
friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast thou any reason
for asking me that question?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And has he been 
long in your service?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Several years,&rsquo; 
replied the Quaker.&nbsp; &lsquo;I took him into my house out of 
compassion, he being an orphan; but as the chaise is waiting, I 
will bid thee farewell.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid I must 
stop your journey for the present,&rsquo; said the surgeon; 
&lsquo;that boy has exactly the same blemish in the eye which a 
boy had who was in company with the man at Horncastle, from whom 
my friend received the forged notes, and who there passed for his
son.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing about that,&rsquo; said 
the Quaker, &lsquo;but I am determined to be detained here no 
longer, after the satisfactory account which I have given as to 
the note&rsquo;s coming into my possession.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then 
attempted to leave the room, but my friend detained him, a 
struggle ensued, during which a wig which the Quaker wore fell 
off, whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some twenty years of
his age.&nbsp; &lsquo;Knock the fellow down, father,&rsquo; said 
the boy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, forsooth, the pretended Quaker took the 
boy&rsquo;s advice, and knocked my friend down in a 
twinkling.&nbsp; The landlord, however, and waiter, seeing how 
matters stood, instantly laid hold of him; but there can be no 
doubt that he would have escaped from the whole three, had not 
certain guests who were in the house, hearing the noise, rushed 
in, and helped to secure him.&nbsp; The boy was true to his word,
assisting him to the best of his ability, flinging himself 
between the legs of his father&rsquo;s assailants, causing 
several of them to stumble and fall.&nbsp; At length the fellow 
was secured, and led before a magistrate; the boy, to whom he was
heard to say something which nobody understood, and to whom, 
after the man&rsquo;s capture, no one paid much attention, was no
more seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest, as far as this man was concerned, may be told
in a few words; nothing to criminate him was found on his person,
but on his baggage being examined, a quantity of spurious notes 
were discovered.&nbsp; Much of his hardihood now forsook him, and
in the hope of saving his life he made some very important 
disclosures; amongst other things, he confessed that it was he 
who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses, and also 
the note to be changed.&nbsp; He was subsequently tried on two 
indictments, in the second of which I appeared against him.&nbsp;
He was condemned to die; but, in consideration of the disclosures
he had made, his sentence was commuted to perpetual 
transportation.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;My innocence was thus perfectly established 
before the eyes of the world, and all my friends hastened to 
congratulate me.&nbsp; There was one who congratulated me more 
than all the rest&mdash;it was my beloved one, 
but&mdash;but&mdash;she was dying . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the old man drew his hand before his eyes, and remained 
for some time without speaking; at length he removed his hand, 
and commenced again with a broken voice: &ldquo;You will pardon 
me if I hurry over this part of my story, I am unable to dwell 
upon it.&nbsp; How dwell upon a period when I saw my only earthly
treasure pine away gradually day by day, and knew that nothing 
could save her!&nbsp; She saw my agony, and did all she could to 
console me, saying that she was herself quite resigned.&nbsp; A 
little time before her death she expressed a wish that we should 
be united.&nbsp; I was too happy to comply with her 
request.&nbsp; We were united, I brought her to this house, 
where, in less than a week, she expired in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p>THE OLD MAN&rsquo;S STORY CONTINUED&mdash;MISERY IN THE 
HEAD&mdash;THE STRANGE MARKS&mdash;TEA-DEALER FROM 
LONDON&mdash;DIFFICULTIES OF THE CHINESE LANGUAGE.</p>
<p>After another pause the old man once more resumed his 
narration:&mdash;&ldquo;If ever there was a man perfectly 
miserable it was myself, after the loss of that cherished 
woman.&nbsp; I sat solitary in the house, in which I had hoped in
her company to realise the choicest earthly happiness, a prey to 
the bitterest reflections; many people visited and endeavoured to
console me&mdash;amongst them was the clergyman of the parish, 
who begged me to be resigned, and told me that it was good to be 
afflicted.&nbsp; I bowed my head, but I could not help thinking 
how easy it must be for those who feel no affliction, to bid 
others to be resigned, and to talk of the benefit resulting from 
sorrow; perhaps I should have paid more attention to his 
discourse than I did, provided he had been a person for whom it 
was possible to entertain much respect, but his own heart was 
known to be set on the things of this world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a little time he had an opportunity, in his own 
case, of practising resignation, and of realising the benefit of 
<!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
197</span>being afflicted.&nbsp; A merchant, to whom he had 
entrusted all his fortune, in the hope of a large interest, 
became suddenly a bankrupt, with scarcely any assets.&nbsp; I 
will not say that it was owing to this misfortune that the divine
died within less than a month after its occurrence, but such was 
the fact.&nbsp; Amongst those who most frequently visited me was 
my friend the surgeon; he did not confine himself to the common 
topics of consolation, but endeavoured to impress upon me the 
necessity of rousing myself, advising me to occupy my mind with 
some pursuit, particularly recommending agriculture; but 
agriculture possessed no interest for me, nor, indeed, any 
pursuit within my reach; my hopes of happiness had been blighted,
and what cared I for anything; so at last he thought it best to 
leave me to myself, hoping that time would bring with it 
consolation; and I remained solitary in my house, waited upon by 
a male and a female servant.&nbsp; Oh, what dreary moments I 
passed!&nbsp; My only amusement&mdash;and it was a sad 
one&mdash;was to look at the things which once belonged to my 
beloved, and which were now in my possession.&nbsp; Oh, how 
fondly would I dwell upon them!&nbsp; There were some books; I 
cared not for books, but these had belonged to my beloved.&nbsp; 
Oh, how fondly did I dwell on them!&nbsp; Then there was her hat 
and bonnet&mdash;oh, me, how fondly did I gaze upon them! and 
after looking at her things for hours, I would sit and ruminate 
on the happiness I had lost.&nbsp; How I execrated the moment I 
had gone to the fair to sell horses!&nbsp; &lsquo;Would that I 
had never been at Horncastle to sell horses!&rsquo; I would say; 
&lsquo;I might at this moment have been enjoying the company of 
my beloved, leading a happy, quiet, easy life, but for that fatal
expedition;&rsquo; that thought worked on my brain, till my brain
seemed to turn round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I sat at the breakfast table gazing vacantly 
around me, my mind was in a state of inexpressible misery; there 
was a whirl in my brain, probably like that which people feel who
are rapidly going mad; this increased to such a degree that I 
felt giddiness coming upon me.&nbsp; To abate this feeling I no 
longer permitted my eyes to wander about, but fixed them upon an 
object on the table, and continued gazing at it for several 
minutes without knowing what it was; at length, the misery in my 
head was somewhat stilled, my lips moved, and I heard myself 
saying, &lsquo;What odd marks!&rsquo;&nbsp; I had fastened my 
eyes on the side of a teapot, and by keeping them fixed upon it, 
had become aware of a fact that had escaped my notice 
before&mdash;<!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>namely, that there were marks upon 
it.&nbsp; I kept my eyes fixed upon them, and repeated at 
intervals, &lsquo;What strange marks!&rsquo;&mdash;for I thought 
that looking upon the marks tended to abate the whirl in my head:
I kept tracing the marks one after the other, and I observed that
though they all bore a general resemblance to each other, they 
were all to a certain extent different.&nbsp; The smallest 
portion possible of curious interest had been awakened within me,
and, at last, I asked myself, within my own mind, &lsquo;What 
motive could induce people to put such odd marks on their 
crockery? they were not pictures, they were not letters; what 
motive could people have for putting them there?&rsquo;&nbsp; At 
last I removed my eyes from the teapot, and thought for a few 
moments about the marks; presently, however, I felt the whirl 
returning; the marks became almost effaced from my mind, and I 
was beginning to revert to my miserable ruminations, when 
suddenly methought I heard a voice say, &lsquo;The marks! the 
marks! cling to the marks! or . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; So I fixed my 
eyes again upon the marks, inspecting them more attentively, if 
possible, than I had done before, and, at last, I came to the 
conclusion that they were not capricious or fanciful marks, but 
were arranged systematically; when I had gazed at them for a 
considerable time I turned the teapot round, and on the other 
side I observed marks of a similar kind, which I soon discovered 
were identical with the ones I had been observing.&nbsp; All the 
marks were something alike, but all somewhat different, and on 
comparing them with each other, I was struck with the frequent 
occurrence of a mark crossing an upright line, or projecting from
it, now on the right, now on the left side; and I said to myself,
&lsquo;Why does this mark sometimes cross the upright line, and 
sometimes project?&rsquo; and the more I thought on the matter, 
the less did I feel of the misery in my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things were at length removed, and I sat, as I had 
for some time past been wont to sit after my meals, silent and 
motionless; but in the present instance my mind was not entirely 
abandoned to the one mournful idea which had so long distressed 
it.&nbsp; It was, to a certain extent, occupied with the marks on
the teapot; it is true that the mournful idea strove hard with 
the marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind, and at last 
the painful idea drove the marks of the teapot out; they, 
however, would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a 
moment or two, and their coming was like a momentary relief from 
intense pain.&nbsp; I thought once or twice <!-- page 199--><a 
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>that I 
would have the teapot placed before me that I might examine the 
marks at leisure, but I considered that it would be as well to 
defer the re-examination of the marks till the next morning; at 
that time I did not take tea of an evening.&nbsp; By deferring 
the examination thus, I had something to look forward to on the 
next morning.&nbsp; The day was a melancholy one, but it 
certainly was more tolerable to me than any of the others had 
been since the death of my beloved.&nbsp; As I lay awake that 
night I occasionally thought of the marks, and in my sleep 
methought I saw them upon the teapot vividly before me.&nbsp; On 
the morrow, I examined the marks again; how singular they 
looked!&nbsp; Surely they must mean something, and if so, what 
could they mean? and at last I thought within myself whether it 
would be possible for me to make out what they meant: that day I 
felt more relief than on the preceding one, and towards night I 
walked a little about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about a week&rsquo;s time I received a visit from my
friend the surgeon; after a little discourse, he told me that he 
perceived I was better than when he had last seen me, and asked 
me what I had been about; I told him that I had been principally 
occupied in considering certain marks which I had found on a 
teapot, and wondering what they could mean; he smiled at first, 
but instantly assuming a serious look, he asked to see the 
teapot.&nbsp; I produced it, and after having surveyed the marks 
with attention, he observed that they were highly curious, and 
also wondered what they meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;I strongly advise 
you,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to attempt to make them out, and also
to take moderate exercise, and to see after your 
concerns.&rsquo;&nbsp; I followed his advice; every morning I 
studied the marks on the teapot, and in the course of the day 
took moderate exercise, and attended to little domestic matters 
as became the master of a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I subsequently learned that the surgeon, in advising me
to study the marks and endeavour to make out their meaning, 
merely hoped that by means of them my mind might by degrees be 
diverted from the mournful idea on which it had so long 
brooded.&nbsp; He was a man well skilled in his profession, but 
had read and thought very little on matters unconnected with 
it.&nbsp; He had no idea that the marks had any particular 
signification, or were anything else but common and fortuitous 
one.&nbsp; That I became at all acquainted with their nature was 
owing to a ludicrous circumstance which I will now relate.</p>
<p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;One day, chancing to be at a neighbouring town, 
I was struck with the appearance of a shop recently 
established.&nbsp; It had an immense bow-window, and every part 
of it to which a brush could be applied was painted in a gaudy 
flaming style.&nbsp; Large bowls of green and black tea were 
placed upon certain chests, which stood at the window.&nbsp; I 
stopped to look at them, such a display, whatever it may be at 
the present time, being, at the period of which I am speaking, 
quite uncommon in a country town.&nbsp; The tea, whether black or
green, was very shining and inviting, and the bowls, of which 
there were three, standing on as many chests, were very grand and
foreign-looking.&nbsp; Two of these were white, with figures and 
trees painted upon them in blue; the other, which was the 
middlemost, had neither trees nor figures upon it, but, as I 
looked through the window, appeared to have on its sides the very
same kind of marks which I had observed on the teapot at home; 
there were also marks on the tea-chests, somewhat similar, but 
much larger, and, apparently, not executed with so much 
care.&nbsp; &lsquo;Best teas direct from China,&rsquo; said a 
voice close to my side; and looking round I saw a youngish man 
with a frizzled head, flat face, and an immensely wide mouth, 
standing in his shirt-sleeves by the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Direct 
from China,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;perhaps you will do me the 
favour to walk in and scent them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not 
want any tea,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I was only standing at the 
window examining those marks on the bowl and the chests.&nbsp; I 
have observed similar ones on a teapot at home.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Pray walk in, sir,&rsquo; said the young fellow, extending
his mouth till it reached nearly from ear to ear; &lsquo;pray 
walk in, and I shall be happy to give you any information 
respecting the manners and customs of the Chinese in my 
power.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I followed him into his shop, where
he began to harangue on the manners, customs, and peculiarities 
of the Chinese, especially their manner of preparing tea, not 
forgetting to tell me that the only genuine Chinese tea ever 
imported into England was to be found in his shop.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;With respect to those marks,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;on the
bowl and the chests, they are nothing more nor less than Chinese 
writing expressing something, though what I can&rsquo;t exactly 
tell you.&nbsp; Allow me to sell you this pound of tea,&rsquo; he
added, showing me a paper parcel.&nbsp; &lsquo;On the envelope 
there is a printed account of the Chinese system of writing, 
extracted from authors of the most established reputation.&nbsp; 
These things I print, principally <!-- page 201--><a 
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>with the 
hope of, in some degree, removing the worse than Gothic ignorance
prevalent amongst the natives of these parts.&nbsp; I am from 
London myself.&nbsp; With respect to all that relates to the 
Chinese real imperial tea, I assure you, sir that . . . 
&rsquo;&nbsp; Well to make short of what you doubtless consider a
very tiresome story, I purchased the tea and carried it 
home.&nbsp; The tea proved imperially bad, but the paper envelope
really contained some information on the Chinese language and 
writing, amounting to about as much as you gained from me the 
other day.&nbsp; On learning that the marks on the teapot 
expressed words, I felt my interest with respect to them 
considerably increased, and returned to the task of inspecting 
them with greater zeal than before, hoping, by continually 
looking at them, to be able eventually to understand their 
meaning, in which hope you may easily believe I was disappointed,
though my desire to understand what they represented continued on
the increase.&nbsp; In this dilemma I determined to apply again 
to the shopkeeper from whom I bought the tea.&nbsp; I found him 
in rather low spirits, his shirt-sleeves were soiled, and his 
hair was out of curl.&nbsp; On my inquiring how he got on, he 
informed me that he intended speedily to leave, having received 
little or no encouragement, the people, in their Gothic 
ignorance, preferring to deal with an old-fashioned shopkeeper 
over the way, who, so far from possessing any acquaintance with 
the polity and institutions of the Chinese, did not, he firmly 
believed, know that tea came from China.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are 
come for some more, I suppose?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; On receiving
an answer in the negative he looked somewhat blank, but when I 
added that I came to consult with him as to the means which I 
must take in order to acquire the Chinese language he brightened 
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must get a grammar,&rsquo; said he, rubbing 
his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you not one?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;but any bookseller can 
procure you one.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I was taking my departure, he 
told me that as he was about to leave the neighbourhood, the bowl
at the window, which bore the inscription, besides some other 
pieces of porcelain of a similar description, were at my service 
provided I chose to purchase them.&nbsp; I consented, and two or 
three days afterwards took from off his hands all the china in 
his possession which bore inscriptions, paying what he 
demanded.&nbsp; Had I waited till the sale of his effects, which 
occurred within a few weeks, I could probably have procured <!-- 
page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>it for a fifth part of the sum which I paid, the other 
pieces realising very little.&nbsp; I did not, however, grudge 
the poor fellow what he got from me, as I considered myself to be
somewhat in his debt for the information he had afforded me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the rest of my story, it may be briefly 
told.&nbsp; I followed the advice of the shopkeeper, and applied 
to a bookseller, who wrote to his correspondent in London.&nbsp; 
After a long interval, I was informed that if I wished to learn 
Chinese, I must do so through the medium of French; there being 
neither Chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language.&nbsp; I 
was at first very much disheartened.&nbsp; I determined, however,
at last to gratify my desire of learning Chinese, even at the 
expense of learning French.&nbsp; I procured the books, and in 
order to qualify myself to turn them to account, took lessons in 
French from a little Swiss, the usher of a neighbouring 
boarding-school.&nbsp; I was very stupid in acquiring French; 
perseverance, however, enabled me to acquire a knowledge 
sufficient for the object I had in view.&nbsp; In about two years
I began to study Chinese by myself, through the medium of the 
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and how did you get on with
the study of Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with
the study of Chinese, enumerating all the difficulties he had had
to encounter; dilating upon his frequent despondency of mind, and
occasionally his utter despair of ever mastering Chinese.&nbsp; 
He told me that more than once he had determined upon giving up 
the study, but then the misery in his head forthwith returned, to
escape from which he had as often resumed it.&nbsp; It appeared, 
however, that ten years elapsed before he was able to use ten of 
the two hundred and fourteen keys which serve to undo the locks 
of Chinese writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you able at present to use the entire 
number?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I can at present 
use the whole number.&nbsp; I know the key for every particular 
lock, though I frequently find the wards unwilling to give 
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has nothing particular occurred to you,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;during the time that you have been prosecuting your 
studies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the whole time in which I have been engaged in 
these studies,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;only one 
circumstance has occurred which requires any particular 
mention&mdash;the death of <!-- page 203--><a 
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>my old 
friend the surgeon&mdash;who was carried off suddenly by a fit of
apoplexy.&nbsp; His death was a great shock to me, and for a time
interrupted my studies.&nbsp; His son, however, who succeeded 
him, was very kind to me, and, in some degree, supplied his 
father&rsquo;s place; and I gradually returned to my Chinese 
locks and keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in applying keys to the Chinese locks you employ 
your time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;in making out the 
inscriptions on the various pieces of porcelain, which I have at 
different times procured, I pass my time.&nbsp; The first 
inscription which I translated was that on the teapot of my 
beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at 
present in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifteen hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you obtain them?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without much labour,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;in
the neighbouring towns and villages&mdash;chiefly at 
auctions&mdash;of which, about twenty years ago, there were many 
in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask your reasons for confining your studies 
entirely to the crockery literature of China, when you have all 
the rest at your disposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inscriptions enable me to pass my time,&rdquo; said
the old man; &ldquo;what more would the whole literature of China
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from those inscriptions,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what
a book it is in your power to make, whenever so disposed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Translations from the crockery literature of 
China.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a book would be sure to take; even 
glorious John himself would not disdain to publish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no desire for literary
distinction,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no ambition.&nbsp; My 
original wish was to pass my life in easy, quiet obscurity, with 
her whom I loved.&nbsp; I was disappointed in my wish; she was 
removed, who constituted my only felicity in this life; 
desolation came to my heart, and misery to my head.&nbsp; To 
escape from the latter I had recourse to Chinese.&nbsp; By 
degrees the misery left my head, but the desolation of heart yet 
remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;through the 
instrumentality of this affliction you have learnt Chinese, and, 
in so doing, learnt to practise the duties of hospitality.&nbsp; 
Who but a man who could read Runes on a teapot, would have 
received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have received 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;let us 
hope that all is for the best.&nbsp; I am by nature indolent, 
and, but for this affliction, should perhaps have hardly taken 
the trouble to do my duty to my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I am 
very, very indolent,&rdquo; said he, slightly glancing towards 
the clock; &ldquo;therefore let us hope that all is for the best;
but, oh! these trials, they are very hard to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p>THE LEAVE-TAKING&mdash;SPIRIT OF THE HEARTH&mdash;WHAT&rsquo;S
O&rsquo;CLOCK.</p>
<p>The next morning, having breakfasted with my old friend, I 
went into the stable to make the necessary preparations for my 
departure; there, with the assistance of a stable lad, I cleaned 
and caparisoned my horse, and then, returning into the house, I 
made the old female attendant such a present as I deemed would be
of some compensation for the trouble I had caused.&nbsp; Hearing 
that the old gentleman was in his study, I repaired to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am come to take leave of you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and 
to thank you for all the hospitality which I have received at 
your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eyes of the old man were fixed 
steadfastly on the inscription which I had found him studying on 
a former occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;At length,&rdquo; he murmured to 
himself, &ldquo;I have it&mdash;I think I have it;&rdquo; and 
then, looking at me, he said, &ldquo;So you are about to 
depart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my horse will be at the 
front door in a few minutes; I am glad, however, before I go, to 
find that you have mastered the inscription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I believe I have 
mastered it; it seems to consist of some verses relating to the 
worship of the Spirit of the Hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the Spirit of the Hearth?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the many demons which the Chinese 
worship,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;they do not worship one 
God, but many.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the old man told me a great 
many highly-interesting particulars respecting the demon worship 
of the Chinese.</p>
<p>After the lapse of at least half-an-hour I said, &ldquo;I must
not linger here any longer, however willing.&nbsp; Horncastle is 
distant, and I wish to be there to-night.&nbsp; Pray can you 
inform me what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>The old man, rising, looked towards the clock which 
hung on the side of the room at his left hand, on the farther 
side of the table at which he was seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather short-sighted,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and 
cannot distinguish the numbers at that distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the old man; 
&ldquo;I believe somewhat past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;a quarter, 
or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven minutes, or ten minutes past ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the old man, 
with a smile, &ldquo;there is one thing to the knowledge of which
I could never exactly attain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you do 
not know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give a guess,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;to 
within a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot tell the exact moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with that 
thing there on the wall continually ticking in your ear, how 
comes it that you do not know what&rsquo;s 
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have contented 
myself with giving a tolerably good guess; to do more would have 
been too great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have learnt Chinese,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have learnt 
Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I really would counsel you 
to learn to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock as soon as 
possible.&nbsp; Consider what a sad thing it would be to go out 
of the world not knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A 
millionth part of the trouble required to learn Chinese would, if
employed, infallibly teach you to know what&rsquo;s 
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a motive for learning Chinese,&rdquo; said the 
old man, &ldquo;the hope of appeasing the misery in my 
head.&nbsp; With respect to not knowing what&rsquo;s 
o&rsquo;clock, I cannot see anything particularly sad in the 
matter.&nbsp; A man may get through the world very creditably 
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Yet, upon the 
whole, it is no bad thing to know what&rsquo;s 
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;you of course, do?&nbsp; It would be too good
a joke if two people <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>were to be together, one knowing 
Armenian and the other Chinese, and neither knowing what&rsquo;s 
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll now see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p>ARRIVAL AT HORNCASTLE&mdash;THE INN AND OSTLERS&mdash;THE 
GARRET&mdash;FIGURE OF A MAN WITH A CANDLE.</p>
<p>Leaving the house of the old man who knew Chinese, but could 
not tell what was o&rsquo;clock, I wended my way to Horncastle, 
which I reached in the evening of the same day, without having 
met any adventure on the way worthy of being marked down in this 
very remarkable history.</p>
<p>The town was a small one, seemingly ancient, and was crowded 
with people and horses.&nbsp; I proceeded, without delay, to the 
inn to which my friend the surgeon had directed me.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is of no use coming here,&rdquo; said two or three 
ostlers, as I entered the yard&mdash;&ldquo;all full&mdash;no 
room whatever;&rdquo; whilst one added, in an undertone, 
&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bad-looking 
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see the master of this 
inn,&rdquo; said I, as I dismounted from the horse.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;See the master,&rdquo; said an ostler&mdash;the same who 
had paid the negative kind of compliment to the 
horse&mdash;&ldquo;a likely thing, truly; my master is drinking 
wine with some of the grand gentry, and can&rsquo;t be disturbed 
for the sake of the like of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I bring a 
letter to him,&rdquo; said I, pulling out the surgeon&rsquo;s 
epistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would deliver it to him,&rdquo; 
I added, offering a half-crown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, 
is it?&rdquo; said the ostler, taking the letter and the half 
crown; &ldquo;my master will be right glad to see you; why, you 
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been here for many a year; I&rsquo;ll carry 
the note to him at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with these words he 
hurried into the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice horse, 
young man,&rdquo; said another ostler, &ldquo;what will you take 
for it?&rdquo; to which interrogation I made no answer.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;If you wish to sell him,&rdquo; said the ostler, coming up
to me, and winking knowingly, &ldquo;I think I and my partners 
might offer you a summut under seventy pounds;&rdquo; to which 
kind of half-insinuated offer I made no reply, save by winking in
the same kind of knowing manner in which I had observed him 
wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather leary!&rdquo; said a third 
ostler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, young man, perhaps you will drink 
to-night with me and my partners, when we can talk the matter 
<!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
207</span>over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I had time to answer, the 
landlord, a well-dressed, good-looking man, made his appearance 
with the ostler; he bore the letter in his hand.&nbsp; Without 
glancing at me he betook himself at once to consider the horse, 
going round him, and observing every point with the utmost 
minuteness.&nbsp; At last, after having gone round the horse 
three times, he stopped beside me, and keeping his eyes on the 
horse, bent his head towards his right shoulder.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That horse is worth some money,&rdquo; said he, turning 
towards me suddenly, and slightly touching me on the arm with the
letter which he held in his hand; to which observation I made no 
reply, save by bending my head towards the right shoulder as I 
had seen him do.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young man is going to talk to 
me and my partners about it to-night,&rdquo; said the ostler who 
had expressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me 
somewhat under seventy pounds for the animal.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;the young man knows
what he is about; in the meantime lead the horse to the reserved 
stall, and see well after him.&nbsp; My friend,&rdquo; said he, 
taking me aside after the ostler had led the animal away, 
&ldquo;recommends you to me in the strongest manner, on which 
account alone I take you and your horse in.&nbsp; I need not 
advise you not to be taken in, as I should say, by your look, 
that you are tolerably awake; but there are queer hands at 
Horncastle at this time, and those fellows of mine, you 
understand me . . .; but I have a great deal to do at present, so
you must excuse me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon went into the 
house.</p>
<p>That same evening I was engaged at least two hours in the 
stable, in rubbing the horse down, and preparing him for the 
exhibition which I intended he should make in the fair on the 
following day.&nbsp; The ostler, to whom I had given the 
half-crown, occasionally assisted me, though he was too much 
occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of 
time to the service of mine; he more than once repeated to me his
firm conviction that himself and partners could afford to offer 
me summut for the horse; and at a later hour when, in compliance 
with his invitation, I took a glass of summut with himself and 
partners, in a little room surrounded with corn-chests, on which 
we sat, both himself and partners endeavoured to impress upon me,
chiefly by means of nods and winks, their conviction that they 
could afford to give me summut for the horse, provided I were 
disposed to sell him; in return for <!-- page 208--><a 
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>which 
intimation, with as many nods and winks as they had all 
collectively used, I endeavoured to impress upon them my 
conviction that I could get summut handsomer in the fair than 
they might be disposed to offer me, seeing as how&mdash;which how
I followed by a wink and a nod, which they seemed perfectly to 
understand, one or two of them declaring that if the case was so,
it made a great deal of difference, and that they did not wish to
be any hindrance to me, more particularly as it was quite clear I
had been an ostler like themselves.</p>
<p>It was late at night when I began to think of retiring to 
rest.&nbsp; On inquiring if there was any place in which I could 
sleep, I was informed that there was a bed at my service, 
provided I chose to sleep in a two-bedded room, one of the beds 
of which was engaged by another gentleman.&nbsp; I expressed my 
satisfaction at this arrangement, and was conducted by a 
maid-servant up many pairs of stairs to a garret, in which were 
two small beds, in one of which she gave me to understand another
gentleman slept; he had, however, not yet retired to rest; I 
asked who he was, but the maid-servant could give me no 
information about him, save that he was a highly respectable 
gentleman, and a friend of her master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Presently, 
bidding me good-night, she left me with a candle; and I, having 
undressed myself and extinguished the light, went to bed.&nbsp; 
Notwithstanding the noises which sounded from every part of the 
house, I was not slow in falling asleep, being thoroughly 
tired.&nbsp; I know not how long I might have been in bed, 
perhaps two hours, when I was partially awakened by a light 
shining upon my face, whereupon, unclosing my eyes, I perceived 
the figure of a man, with a candle in one hand, staring at my 
face, whilst with the other hand he held back the curtain of the 
bed.&nbsp; As I have said before, I was only partially awakened, 
my power of perception was consequently very confused; it 
appeared to me, however, that the man was dressed in a green 
coat; that he had curly brown or black hair, and that there was 
something peculiar in his look.&nbsp; Just as I was beginning to 
recollect myself, the curtain dropped, and I heard, or thought I 
heard, a voice say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know the 
cove.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then there was a rustling like a person 
undressing, whereupon being satisfied that it was my 
fellow-lodger, I dropped asleep, but was awakened again by a kind
of heavy plunge upon the other bed, which caused it to rock and 
creak, when I observed that the light had been extinguished, 
probably blown out, if I might <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>judge from 
a rather disagreeable smell of burnt wick which remained in the 
room, and which kept me awake till I heard my companion breathing
hard, when, turning on the other side, I was again once more 
speedily in the arms of slumber.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p>HORNCASTLE FAIR.</p>
<p>It had been my intention to be up and doing early on the 
following morning, but my slumbers proved so profound, that I did
not wake until about eight; on arising, I again found myself the 
sole occupant of the apartment, my more alert companion having 
probably risen at a much earlier hour.&nbsp; Having dressed 
myself, I descended, and going to the stable, found my horse 
under the hands of my friend the ostler, who was carefully 
rubbing him down.&nbsp; &ldquo;There a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a better 
horse in the fair,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;and as you are 
one of us, and appear to be all right, I&rsquo;ll give you a 
piece of advice&mdash;don&rsquo;t take less than a hundred and 
fifty for him; if you mind your hits, you may get it, for I have 
known two hundred given in this fair for one no better, if so 
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;thank you 
for your advice, which I will take, and, if successful, will give
you &lsquo;summut&rsquo; handsome.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank 
you,&rdquo; said the ostler; &ldquo;and now let me ask whether 
you are up to all the ways of this here place?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I have never been here before,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
have a pair of tolerably sharp eyes in my head.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That I see you have,&rdquo; said the ostler, &ldquo;but 
many a body, with as sharp a pair of eyes as yourn, has lost his 
horse in this fair, for want of having been here before, 
therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a caution 
or two.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the ostler proceeded to give me at
least half-a-dozen cautions, only two of which I shall relate to 
the reader:&mdash;the first, not to stop to listen to what any 
chance customer might have to say; and the last&mdash;the one on 
which he appeared to lay most stress&mdash;by no manner of means 
to permit a Yorkshireman to get up into the saddle, 
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you do, it is three to one 
he rides off with the horse; he can&rsquo;t help it; trust a cat 
amongst cream, but never trust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a 
good horse.&nbsp; By-the-bye,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that 
saddle of yours is not a particularly <!-- page 210--><a 
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>good one, 
no more is the bridle.&nbsp; A shabby saddle and bridle have more
than once spoiled the sale of a good horse.&nbsp; I tell you 
what, as you seem a decent kind of a young chap, I&rsquo;ll lend 
you a saddle and bridle of my master&rsquo;s, almost bran new; he
won&rsquo;t object I know, as you are a friend of his, only you 
must not forget your promise to come down with summut handsome 
after you have sold the animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked 
out in his borrowed finery, really looked better by a large sum 
of money than on any former occasion.&nbsp; Making my way out of 
the yard of the inn, I was instantly in the principal street of 
the town, up and down which an immense number of horses were 
being exhibited, some led, and others with riders.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
wonderful small quantity of good horses in the fair this 
time!&rdquo; I heard a stout jockey-looking individual say, who 
was staring up the street with his side towards me.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Halloo, young fellow!&rdquo; said he, a few moments after 
I had passed, &ldquo;whose horse is that?&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I 
want to look at him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Though confident that he was 
addressing himself to me, I took no notice, remembering the 
advice of the ostler, and proceeded up the street.&nbsp; My horse
possessed a good walking step; but walking, as the reader knows, 
was not his best pace, which was the long trot, at which I could 
not well exercise him in the street, on account of the crowd of 
men and animals; however, as he walked along, I could easily 
perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst those who,
by their jockey dress and general appearance, I imagined to be 
connoisseurs; I heard various calls to stop, to none of which I 
paid the slightest attention.&nbsp; In a few minutes I found 
myself out of the town, when, turning round for the purpose of 
returning, I found I had been followed by several of the 
connoisseur-looking individuals, whom I had observed in the 
fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now would be the time for a display,&rdquo; 
thought I; and looking around me I observed two five-barred 
gates, one on each side of the road, and fronting each 
other.&nbsp; Turning my horse&rsquo;s head to one, I pressed my 
heels to his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an encouraging 
cry, whereupon the animal cleared the gate in a twinkling.&nbsp; 
Before he had advanced ten yards in the field to which the gate 
opened, I had turned him round, and again giving him cry and 
rein, I caused him to leap back again into the road, and still 
allowing him head, I made him leap the other gate; and forthwith 
turning him round, I caused him to leap once more into the road, 
<!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
211</span>where he stood proudly tossing his head, as much as to 
say, &ldquo;What more?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine horse! a 
capital horse!&rdquo; said several of the connoisseurs.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What do you ask for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Too much for 
any of you to pay,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A horse like this 
is intended for other kind of customers than any of 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; said one; 
the very same person whom I had heard complaining in the street 
of the paucity of good horses in the fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let
us know what you ask for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A hundred and 
fifty pounds!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;neither more nor 
less.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you call that a great price?&rdquo; 
said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I thought you would have asked 
double that amount!&nbsp; You do yourself injustice, young 
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but 
that&rsquo;s my affair; I do not choose to take 
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would let me get into the 
saddle,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;the horse knows you, and 
therefore shows to more advantage; but I should like to see how 
he would move under me, who am a stranger.&nbsp; Will you let me 
get into the saddle, young man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;I will not let you get into the 
saddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lest you should be a Yorkshireman,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and should run away with the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yorkshire?&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I am from Suffolk; 
silly Suffolk&mdash;so you need not be afraid of my running away 
with the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! if that&rsquo;s the 
case,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should be afraid that the horse 
would run away with you; so I will by no means let you 
mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you let me look in his 
mouth?&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; 
said I; &ldquo;but I tell you, he&rsquo;s apt to 
bite.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He can scarcely be a worse bite than 
his master,&rdquo; said the man, looking into the horse&rsquo;s 
mouth; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s four off.&nbsp; I say, young man, will 
you warrant this horse?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;I never warrant horses; the horses that I ride can always 
warrant themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would let me 
speak a word to you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just come 
aside.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rdquo; said he, in a half 
whisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rdquo; said he, placing his hand 
upon the pommel of the saddle and looking up in my face, 
&ldquo;and I think I can find you a customer.&nbsp; If you would 
take a hundred, I think my lord would purchase it, for he has 
sent me about the fair to look him up a horse, by which he could 
hope to make an honest penny.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;and could he not make an honest penny and yet give
me the price I ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the 
go-between, &ldquo;a hundred and fifty pounds is as much as the 
animal is worth, or nearly so; and my lord, do you see . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see no reason <!-- page 212--><a 
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>at 
all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why I should sell the animal for less 
than he is worth, in order that his lordship may be benefited by 
him; so that if his lordship wants to make an honest penny, he 
must find some person who would consider the disadvantage of 
selling him a horse for less than it is worth, as counterbalanced
by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should never do; 
but I can&rsquo;t be wasting my time here.&nbsp; I am going back 
to the . . ., where if you, or any person, are desirous of 
purchasing the horse, you must come within the next half-hour, or
I shall probably not feel disposed to sell him at 
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Another word, young man,&rdquo; said the
jockey; but without staying to hear what he had to say, I put the
horse to his best trot, and re-entering the town, and threading 
my way as well as I could through the press, I returned to the 
yard of the inn, where, dismounting, I stood still, holding the 
horse by the bridle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p212b.jpg">
<img alt="Horncastle horse fair: scene by the canal.  (From a 
photography by Carlton &amp; Sons, Horncastle.)" 
src="images/p212s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I had been standing in this manner about five minutes, when I 
saw the jockey enter the yard, accompanied by another 
individual.&nbsp; They advanced directly towards me.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Here is my lord come to look at the horse, young 
man,&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; My lord, as the jockey called 
him, was a tall figure, of about five-and-thirty.&nbsp; He had on
his head a hat somewhat rusty, and on his back a surtout of blue 
rather the worse for wear.&nbsp; His forehead, if not high, was 
exceedingly narrow; his eyes were brown, with a rat-like glare in
them; the nose was rather long, and the mouth very wide; the 
cheekbones high, and the cheeks, as to hue and consistency, 
exhibiting very much the appearance of a withered red apple; 
there was a gaunt expression of hunger in the whole 
countenance.&nbsp; He had scarcely glanced at the horse, when, 
drawing in his cheeks, he thrust out his lips very much after the
manner of a baboon when he sees a piece of sugar held out towards
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this horse yours?&rdquo; said he, suddenly 
turning towards me, with a kind of smirk.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
my horse,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;are you the person who wishes to 
make an honest penny by it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How?&rdquo; said 
he, drawing up his head with a very consequential look, and 
speaking with a very haughty tone; &ldquo;what do you 
mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked at each other full in the face; 
after a few moments, the muscles of the mouth of him of the 
hungry look began to move violently, the face was puckered into 
innumerable wrinkles, and the eyes became half closed.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have you ever seen me 
before?&nbsp; I suppose you are asking yourself that 
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said he, 
dropping his lofty look, <!-- page 213--><a 
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>and 
speaking in a very subdued and civil tone, &ldquo;I have never 
had the honour of seeing you before, that is&rdquo;&mdash;said 
he, slightly glancing at me again, and again moving the muscles 
of his mouth, &ldquo;no, I have never seen you before,&rdquo; he 
added, making me a bow, &ldquo;I have never had that pleasure; my
business with you at present, is to inquire the lowest price you 
are willing to take for this horse.&nbsp; My agent here informs 
me that you ask one hundred and fifty pounds, which I cannot 
think of giving&mdash;the horse is a showy horse, but look, my 
dear sir, he has a defect here, and there in his near fore leg I 
observe something which looks very like a splint&mdash;yes, upon 
my credit,&rdquo; said he, touching the animal, &ldquo;he has a 
splint, or something which will end in one.&nbsp; A hundred and 
fifty pounds, sir! what could have induced you ever to ask 
anything like that for this animal?&nbsp; I protest that, in my 
time, I have frequently bought a better for . . .&nbsp; Who are 
you, sir?&nbsp; I am in treaty for this horse,&rdquo; said he to 
a man who had come up whilst he was talking, and was now looking 
into the horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; said 
the man, still looking into the horse&rsquo;s mouth; &ldquo;who 
am I? his lordship asks me.&nbsp; Ah, I see, close on 
five,&rdquo; said he, releasing the horse&rsquo;s jaws, and 
looking at me.&nbsp; This new-comer was a thin, wiry-made 
individual, with wiry curling brown hair; his face was dark, and 
wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression; upon one of his 
eyes was a kind of speck or beam; he might be about forty, wore a
green jockey coat, and held in his hand a black riding whip, with
a knob of silver wire.&nbsp; As I gazed upon his countenance, it 
brought powerfully to my mind the face which, by the light of the
candle, I had seen staring over me on the preceding night, when 
lying in bed and half asleep.&nbsp; Close behind him, and 
seemingly in his company, stood an exceedingly tall figure, that 
of a youth seemingly about one-and-twenty, dressed in a handsome 
riding dress, and wearing on his head a singular hat, green in 
colour, and with a very high peak.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you ask 
for this horse?&rdquo; said he of the green coat, winking at me 
with the eye which had a beam in it, whilst the other shone and 
sparkled like Mrs. Colonel W . . .&rsquo;s Golconda 
diamond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are you, sir, I demand once 
more?&rdquo; said he of the hungry look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who am I? 
why, who should I be but Jack Dale, who buys horses for himself 
and other folk; I want one at present for this short young 
gentleman,&rdquo; said he, motioning with his finger to the 
gigantic youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
214</span>other, &ldquo;and what business have you to interfere 
between me and any purchase I may be disposed to 
make?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the other, 
&ldquo;be quick and purchase the horse, or perhaps I 
may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I am to be dictated to by a
fellow of your description?&rdquo; said his lordship; 
&ldquo;begone, or . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you ask for 
this horse?&rdquo; said the other to me, very coolly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;A hundred and fifty,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
shouldn&rsquo;t mind giving it you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You will do no such thing,&rdquo; said his lordship, 
speaking so fast that he almost stuttered.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;I must give you what you
ask; Symmonds, take possession of the animal for me,&rdquo; said 
he to the other jockey, who attended him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will 
please to do no such thing without my consent,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;I have not sold him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have this 
moment told you that I will give you the price you demand,&rdquo;
said his lordship; &ldquo;is not that sufficient?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is a proper manner of 
doing everything&mdash;had you come forward in a manly and 
gentlemanly manner to purchase the horse, I should have been 
happy to sell him to you, but after all the fault you have found 
with him, I would not sell him to you at any price, so send your 
friend to find up another.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You behave in this
manner, I suppose,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;because this 
fellow has expressed a willingness to come to your terms.&nbsp; I
would advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal in his 
hands; I think I have seen him before, and could tell you . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What can you tell of me?&rdquo; said the 
other, going up to him, &ldquo;except that I have been a poor 
dicky-boy, and that now I am a dealer in horses, and that my 
father was lagged; that is all you could tell of me, and that I 
don&rsquo;t mind telling myself: but there are two things they 
can&rsquo;t say of me, they can&rsquo;t say that I am either a 
coward, or a screw either, except so far as one who gets his 
bread by horses may be expected to be; and they can&rsquo;t say 
of me that I ever ate up an ice which a young woman was waiting 
for, or that I ever backed out of a fight.&nbsp; Horse!&rdquo; 
said he, motioning with his finger tauntingly to the other; 
&ldquo;what do you want with a horse, except to take the bread 
out of the mouth of a poor man&mdash;to-morrow is not the battle 
of Waterloo, so that you don&rsquo;t want to back out of danger, 
by pretending to have hurt yourself by falling from the 
creature&rsquo;s back, my lord of the white feather&mdash;come, 
none of your fierce looks&mdash;I am not afraid of 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, the other had assumed an expression of
the deadliest malice, his teeth were clenched, his lips <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
215</span>quivered, and were quite pale; the rat-like eyes 
sparkled, and he made a half spring, <i>&agrave; la</i> rat, 
towards his adversary, who only laughed.&nbsp; Restraining 
himself, however, he suddenly turned to his understrapper, 
saying, &ldquo;Symmonds, will you see me thus insulted? go and 
trounce this scoundrel; you can, I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Symmonds trounce me!&rdquo; said the other, going up to 
the person addressed, and drawing his hand contemptuously over 
his face; &ldquo;why, I beat Symmonds in this very yard in one 
round three years ago; didn&rsquo;t I, Symmonds?&rdquo; said he 
to the understrapper, who held down his head, muttering in a 
surly tone, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to fight; let every 
one take his own part.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, 
Symmonds,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;especially every one from
whom there is nothing to be got.&nbsp; I would give you 
half-a-crown for all the trouble you have had, provided I were 
not afraid that my Lord Plume there would get it from you as soon
as you leave the yard together.&nbsp; Come, take yourselves both 
off; there&rsquo;s nothing to be made here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, 
his lordship seemed to be of the same opinion, for after a 
further glance at the horse, a contemptuous look at me, and a 
scowl at the jockey, he turned on his heel, muttering something 
which sounded like fellows, and stalked out of the yard, followed
by Symmonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young man,&rdquo; said the jockey, or whatever
he was, turning to me with an arch leer, &ldquo;I suppose I may 
consider myself as the purchaser of this here animal, for the use
and behoof of this young gentleman,&rdquo; making a sign with his
head towards the tall young man by his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no 
means,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am utterly unacquainted with 
either of you, and before parting with the horse I must be 
satisfied as to the respectability of the purchaser.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! as to that matter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have 
plenty of vouchers for my respectability about me;&rdquo; and, 
thrusting his hand into his bosom below his waistcoat, he drew 
out a large bundle of notes.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are the kind of 
things,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which vouch best for a man&rsquo;s
respectability.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;indeed, sometimes these kind of things need vouchers for 
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man looked at me with a peculiar 
look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to say that these notes are not 
sufficient notes?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because if you do I 
shall take the liberty of thinking that you are not over civil, 
and when I thinks a person is not over and above civil I 
sometimes takes off my coat; and when my coat is off . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You sometimes knock people down,&rdquo; I 
added; &ldquo;well, whether you knock me down or not, I beg <!-- 
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
216</span>leave to tell you that I am a stranger in this fair, 
and that I shall part with the horse to nobody who has no better 
guarantee for his respectability than a roll of bank-notes, which
may be good or not for what I know, who am not a judge of such 
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! if you are a stranger 
here,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;as I believe you are, never 
having seen you here before except last night, when I think I saw
you above stairs by the glimmer of a candle&mdash;I say, if you 
are a stranger, you are quite right to be cautious; queer things 
being done in this fair, as nobody knows better than 
myself,&rdquo; he added, with a leer; &ldquo;but I suppose if the
landlord of the house vouches for me and my notes, you will have 
no objection to part with the horse to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and in the meantime 
the horse can return to the stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler.&nbsp;
The landlord of the house, on being questioned by me as to the 
character and condition of my new acquaintance, informed me that 
he was a respectable horse-dealer, and an intimate friend of his,
whereupon the purchase was soon brought to a satisfactory 
conclusion.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>
<p>HIGH DUTCH.</p>
<p>It was evening: and myself and the two acquaintances I had 
made in the fair&mdash;namely, the jockey and the tall 
foreigner&mdash;sat in a large upstairs room, which looked into a
court; we had dined with several people connected with the fair 
at a long table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te; they had now departed, and we
sat at a small side-table with wine and a candle before us; both 
my companions had pipes in their mouths&mdash;the jockey a common
pipe, and the foreigner, one, the syphon of which, made of some 
kind of wood, was at least six feet long, and the bowl of which, 
made of a white kind of substance like porcelain, and capable of 
holding nearly an ounce of tobacco, rested on the ground.&nbsp; 
The jockey frequently emptied and replenished his glass; the 
foreigner sometimes raised his to his lips, for no other purpose 
seemingly than to moisten them, as he never drained his 
glass.&nbsp; As for myself, though I did not smoke, I had a glass
before me, from which I sometimes took a sip.&nbsp; <!-- page 
217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
217</span>The room, notwithstanding the window was flung open, 
was in general so filled with smoke, chiefly that which was drawn
from the huge bowl of the foreigner, that my companions and I 
were frequently concealed from each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The
conversation, which related entirely to the events of the fair, 
was carried on by the jockey and myself, the foreigner, who 
appeared to understand the greater part of what we said, 
occasionally putting in a few observations in broken 
English.&nbsp; At length the jockey, after the other had made 
some ineffectual attempts to express something intelligibly which
he wished to say, observed, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity that so 
fine a fellow as meinheer, and so clever a fellow too, as I 
believe him to be, is not a little better master of our 
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the gentleman a German?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if so,
I can interpret for him anything he wishes to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce you can!&rdquo; said the jockey, taking his 
pipe out of his mouth, and staring at me through the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you speak German,&rdquo; vociferated the foreigner 
in that language.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Isten, I am glad of it!&nbsp; I
wanted to say . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; And here he said in German what 
he wished to say, and which was of no great importance, and which
I translated into English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t put me out,&rdquo; said the 
jockey; &ldquo;what language is that&mdash;Dutch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Dutch,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Dutch, and you speak High Dutch,&mdash;why, I had 
booked you for as great an ignoramus as myself, who can&rsquo;t 
write&mdash;no, nor distinguish in a book a great A from a 
bull&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person may be a very clever man,&rdquo; said 
I&mdash;&ldquo;no, not a clever man, for clever signifies 
clerkly, and a clever man one who is able to read and write, and 
entitled to the benefit of his clergy or clerkship; but a person 
may be a very acute person without being able to read or 
write.&nbsp; I never saw a more acute countenance than your 
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No soft soap,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;for I 
never uses any.&nbsp; However, thank you for your information; I 
have hitherto thought myself a &rsquo;nition clever fellow, but 
from henceforth shall consider myself just the contrary, and 
only&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&mdash;confounded 
&rsquo;cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;as you say you can
speak High <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>Dutch, I should like to hear you and
master six foot six fire away at each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak German,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I can 
understand tolerably well what others say in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, no backing out,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s hear you fire away for the glory of Old 
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a German?&rdquo; said I, in German, to the
foreigner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;keep it 
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A German!&rdquo; said the tall foreigner.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No, I thank God that I do not belong to the stupid 
sluggish Germanic race, but to a braver, taller, and handsomer 
people;&rdquo; here taking the pipe out of his mouth, he stood up
proudly erect, so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the
room, then reseating himself, and again putting the syphon to his
lips, he added, &ldquo;I am a Magyar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The foreigner looked at me for a moment, somewhat 
contemptuously, through the smoke, then said, in a voice of 
thunder, &ldquo;A Hungarian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a voice the chap has when he pleases!&rdquo; 
interposed the jockey; &ldquo;what is he saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that he is a Hungarian,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;but,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;the conversation of this 
gentleman and myself in a language which you can&rsquo;t 
understand must be very tedious to you, we had better give it 
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on with it,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;I shall
go on listening very contentedly till I fall asleep, no bad thing
to do at most times.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<p>THE HUNGARIAN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a countryman of Tekeli, and of the queen 
who made the celebrated water,&rdquo; said I, speaking to the 
Hungarian in German, which I was able to do tolerably well, owing
to my having translated the Publisher&rsquo;s philosophy into 
that language, always provided I did not attempt to say much at a
time.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Ah! you have heard of Tekeli, and of 
L&rsquo;eau de la Reine d&rsquo;Hongrie.&nbsp; How is that?</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have seen a play acted, founded 
on the exploits of Tekeli, and have read Pigault Le Brun&rsquo;s 
beautiful romance, entitled &ldquo;The Barons of Felsheim,&rdquo;
in which he is mentioned.&nbsp; As for the water, I have heard a 
lady, the wife of a master of mine, speak of it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she handsome?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Very.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Did she possess the water?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I should say not; for I have heard her 
express a great curiosity about it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she growing old?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of course not; but why do you put all 
these questions?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the water is said to make 
people handsome, and, above all, to restore to the aged the 
beauty of their youth.&nbsp; Well! Tekeli was my countryman, and 
I have the honour of having some of the blood of the Tekelis in 
my veins; but with respect to the queen, pardon me if I tell you 
that she was not a Hungarian; she was a Pole&mdash;Ersebet by 
name, daughter of Wladislaus Locticus, King of Poland; she was 
the fourth spouse of Caroly the Second, King of the Magyar 
country, who married her in the year 1320.&nbsp; She was a great 
woman and celebrated politician, though at present chiefly known 
by her water.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How came she to invent it?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; If her own account may be believed, 
she did not invent it.&nbsp; After her death, as I have read in 
Florentius of Buda, there was found a statement of the manner in 
which she came by it, written in her own hand, on a fly-leaf of 
her breviary, to the following effect:&mdash;Being afflicted with
a grievous disorder at the age of seventy-two, she received the 
medicine which was called her water, from an old hermit whom she 
never saw before or afterwards; it not only cured her, but 
restored to her all her former beauty, so that the king of Poland
fell in love with her, and made her an offer of marriage which 
she refused for the glory of God, from whose holy angel she 
believed she had received the water.&nbsp; The receipt for making
it and directions for using it were also found on the 
fly-leaf.&nbsp; The principal component parts were burnt wine and
rosemary, passed through an alembic; a drachm of it was to be 
taken once a week, &ldquo;etelbenn vagy italbann,&rdquo; in the 
food or the drink, early in the morning, and the cheeks were to 
be <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>moistened with it every day.&nbsp; The effects, 
according to the statement, were wonderful&mdash;and perhaps they
were upon the queen; but whether the water has been equally 
efficacious on other people, is a point which I cannot 
determine.&nbsp; I should wish to see some old woman who has been
restored to youthful beauty by the use of L&rsquo;eau de la Reine
d&rsquo;Hongrie.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps, if you did, the old gentlewoman 
would hardly be so ingenuous as the queen.&nbsp; But who are the 
Hungarians&mdash;descendants of Attila and his people?</p>
<p>The Hungarian shook his head, and gave me to understand that 
he did not believe that his nation were the descendants of Attila
and his people, though he acknowledged that they were probably of
the same race.&nbsp; Attila and his armies, he said, came and 
disappeared in a very mysterious manner, and that nothing could 
be said with positiveness about them; that the people now known 
as Magyars first made their appearance in Muscovy in the year 
884, under the leadership of Almus, called so from Alom, which, 
in the Hungarian language, signifies a dream; his mother, before 
his birth, having dreamt that the child with which she was 
<i>enceinte</i> would be the father of a long succession of 
kings, which, in fact, was the case; that after beating the 
Russians he entered Hungary, and coming to a place called Ungvar,
from which many people believe that modern Hungary derived its 
name, he captured it, and held in it a grand festival, which 
lasted four days, at the end of which time he resigned the 
leadership of the Magyars to his son Arpad.&nbsp; This Arpad and 
his Magyars utterly subdued Pannonia&mdash;that is, Hungary and 
Transylvania, wresting the government of it from the Sclavonian 
tribes who inhabited it, and settling down amongst them as 
conquerors!&nbsp; After giving me this information, the Hungarian
exclaimed with much animation, &ldquo;A goodly country that which
they had entered on, consisting of a plain surrounded by 
mountains, some of which intersect it here and there, with noble 
rapid rivers, the grandest of which is the mighty Donau; a 
country with tiny volcanoes, casting up puffs of smoke and steam,
and from which hot springs arise, good for the sick; with many 
fountains, some of which are so pleasant to the taste as to be 
preferred to wine; with a generous soil which, warmed by a 
beautiful sun, is able to produce corn, grapes, and even the 
Indian weed; in fact, one of the finest countries in the world, 
which even a Spaniard would pronounce to be nearly equal to 
Spain.&nbsp; Here they <!-- page 221--><a 
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
221</span>rested&mdash;meditating, however, fresh 
conquests.&nbsp; Oh, the Magyars soon showed themselves a mighty 
people.&nbsp; Besides Hungary and Transylvania, they subdued 
Bulgaria and Bosnia, and the land of Tot, now called 
Sclavonia.&nbsp; The generals of Zoltan, the son of Arpad, led 
troops of horsemen to the banks of the Rhine.&nbsp; One of them, 
at the head of a host, besieged Constantinople.&nbsp; It was then
that Botond engaged in combat with a Greek of gigantic stature, 
who came out of the city and challenged the two best men in the 
Magyar army.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the feeblest of the 
Magyars,&rsquo; said Botond, &lsquo;but I will kill thee;&rsquo; 
and he performed his word, having previously given a proof of the
feebleness of his arm by striking his battle-axe through the 
brazen gate, making a hole so big that a child of five years old 
could walk through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of what religion were the old 
Hungarians?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They had some idea of a Supreme Being,
whom they called Isten, which word is still used by the Magyars 
for God; but their chief devotion was directed to sorcerers and 
soothsayers, something like the Schamans of the Siberian 
steppes.&nbsp; They were converted to Christianity chiefly 
through the instrumentality of Istvan or Stephen, called after 
his death St. Istvan, who ascended the throne in the year one 
thousand.&nbsp; He was born in heathenesse, and his original name
was Vojk: he was the first kiraly, or king of the Magyars.&nbsp; 
Their former leaders had been called fejedelmek, or dukes.&nbsp; 
The Magyar language has properly no term either for king or 
house.&nbsp; Kiraly is a word derived from the Sclaves; haz, or 
house, from the Germans, who first taught them to build houses, 
their original dwellings having been tilted waggons.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Many thanks for your account of the great
men of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The great men of my country!&nbsp; I 
have only told you of the . . . Well, I acknowledge that Almus 
and Arpad were great men, but Hungary has produced many greater; 
I will not trouble you by recapitulating all, but there is one 
name I cannot forbear mentioning&mdash;but you have heard of 
it&mdash;even at Horncastle the name of Hunyadi must be 
familiar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It may be so, though I rather doubt it; 
but, however that may be, I confess my ignorance.&nbsp; I have 
never, until this moment, heard of the name of Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not of Hunyadi Janos, not of Hunyadi 
John&mdash;<!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>for the genius of our language 
compels us to put a man&rsquo;s Christian name after his other; 
perhaps you have heard of the name of Corvinus?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I have heard of the name of 
Corvinus.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By my God, I am glad of it; I thought 
our hammer of destruction, our thunderbolt, whom the Greeks 
called Achilles, must be known to the people of Horncastle.&nbsp;
Well, Hunyadi and Corvinus are the same.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Corvinus means the man of the crow, or 
raven.&nbsp; I suppose that your John, when a boy, climbed up to 
a crow or raven&rsquo;s nest, and stole the young; a bold feat, 
well befitting a young hero.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By Isten, you are an acute guesser; a 
robbery there was, but it was not Hunyadi who robbed the raven, 
but the raven who robbed Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was that?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In this manner: Hunyadi, according to 
tradition, was the son of King Sigmond, by a peasant&rsquo;s 
daughter.&nbsp; The king saw and fell in love with her, whilst 
marching against the vaivode of Wallachia.&nbsp; He had some 
difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes, and she 
only yielded at last on the king making her a solemn promise 
that, in the event of her becoming with child by him, he would 
handsomely provide for her and the infant.&nbsp; The king 
proceeded on his expedition; and on his returning in triumph from
Wallachia, again saw the girl, who informed him that she was 
<i>enceinte</i> by him; the king was delighted with the 
intelligence, gave the girl money, and at the same time a ring, 
requesting her, if she brought forth a son, to bring the ring to 
Buda with the child, and present it to him.&nbsp; When her time 
was up, the peasant&rsquo;s daughter brought forth a fair son, 
who was baptised by the name of John.&nbsp; After some time the 
young woman communicated the whole affair to her elder brother, 
whose name was Gaspar, and begged him to convey her and the child
to the king at Buda.&nbsp; The brother consented, and both set 
out, taking the child with them.&nbsp; On their way, the woman, 
wanting to wash her clothes, laid the child down, giving it the 
king&rsquo;s ring to play with.&nbsp; A raven, who saw the 
glittering ring, came flying, and plucking it out of the 
child&rsquo;s hand, carried it up into a tree; the child suddenly
began to cry, and the mother, hearing it, left her washing, and 
running to the child, forthwith missed the ring, but hearing the 
raven croak in the <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>tree she lifted up her eyes, and saw
it with the ring in its beak.&nbsp; The woman, in great terror, 
called her brother, and told him what had happened, adding that 
she durst not approach the king if the raven took away the 
ring.&nbsp; Gaspar, seizing his cross-bow and quiver, ran to the 
tree, where the raven was yet with the ring, and discharged an 
arrow at it, but, being in a great hurry, he missed it; with his 
second shot he was more lucky, for he hit the raven in the 
breast, which, together with the ring, fell to the ground.&nbsp; 
Taking up the ring, they went their way, and shortly arrived at 
Buda.&nbsp; One day, as the king was walking after dinner in his 
outer hall, the woman appeared before him with the child, and, 
showing him the ring, said, &ldquo;Mighty lord! behold this 
token! and take pity upon me and your own son.&rdquo;&nbsp; King 
Sigmond took the child and kissed it, and, after a pause, said to
the mother, &ldquo;You have done right in bringing me the boy; I 
will take care of you, and make him a nobleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
king was as good as his word; he provided for the mother, caused 
the boy to be instructed in knightly exercises, and made him a 
present of the town of Hunyad, in Transylvania, on which account 
he was afterwards called Hunyadi, and gave him, as an armorial 
sign, a raven bearing a ring in his beak.</p>
<p>Such, O young man of Horncastle! is the popular account of the
birth of the great captain of Hungary, as related by Florentius 
of Buda.&nbsp; There are other accounts of his birth, which is, 
indeed, involved in much mystery, and of the reason of his being 
called Corvinus, but as this is the most pleasing, and is, upon 
the whole, founded on quite as good evidence as the others, I 
have selected it for recitation.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I heartily thank you, but you must tell 
me something more of Hunyadi.&nbsp; You call him your great 
captain; what did he do?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Do! what no other man of his day could
have done.&nbsp; He broke the power of the Turk when he was 
coming to overwhelm Europe.&nbsp; From the blows inflicted by 
Hunyadi the Turk never thoroughly recovered; he has been 
frequently worsted in latter times, but none but Hunyadi could 
have routed the armies of Amurath and Mahomed the Second.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was it that he had an opportunity of 
displaying his military genius?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I can hardly tell you, but his valour 
soon made him famous; King Albert made him Ban of Szorenyi.&nbsp;
He <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>became eventually vaivode of Transylvania, and governor
of Hungary.&nbsp; His first grand action was the defeat of the 
Bashaw Isack; and though himself surprised and routed at St. 
Imre, he speedily regained his prestige by defeating the Turks, 
with enormous slaughter, killing their leader, Mezerbeg; and 
subsequently, at the battle of the Iron Gates, he destroyed 
ninety thousand Turks, sent by Amurath to avenge the late 
disgrace.&nbsp; It was then that the Greeks called him 
Achilles.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; He was not always successful.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Who could be always successful against
the early Turk?&nbsp; He was defeated in the battle in which King
Vladislaus lost his life, but his victories outnumbered his 
defeats three-fold.&nbsp; His grandest victory&mdash;perhaps the 
grandest ever achieved by man&mdash;was over the terrible Mahomed
the Second; who, after the taking of Constantinople in 1453, 
said, &ldquo;One God in Heaven&mdash;one king on earth;&rdquo; 
and marched to besiege Belgrade at the head of one hundred and 
fifty thousand men; swearing, by the beard of the prophet, 
&ldquo;that he would sup within it ere two months were 
elapsed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He brought with him dogs, to eat the bodies
of the Christians whom he should take or slay; so says 
Florentius; hear what he also says: The Turk sat down before the 
town towards the end of June 1454, covering the Donau and Szava 
with ships; and on the 4th of July he began to cannonade Belgrade
with cannons twenty-five feet long, whose roar could be heard at 
Szeged, a distance of twenty-four leagues, at which place Hunyadi
had assembled his forces.&nbsp; Hunyadi had been able to raise 
only fifteen thousand of well-armed and disciplined men, though 
he had with him vast bands of people, who called themselves 
Soldiers of the Cross, but who consisted of inexperienced lads 
from school, peasants, and hermits, armed with swords, slings, 
and clubs.&nbsp; Hunyadi, undismayed by the great disparity 
between his forces and those of the Turk, advanced to relieve 
Belgrade, and encamped at Szalankemen with his army.&nbsp; There 
he saw at once that his first step must be to attack the 
flotilla; he therefore privately informed Szilagy, his 
wife&rsquo;s brother, who at that time defended Belgrade, that it
was his intention to attack the ships of the Turks on the 14th 
day of July in front, and requested his co-operation in the 
rear.&nbsp; On the 14th came on the commencement of the great 
battle of Belgrade, between Hunyadi and the Turk.&nbsp; Many days
it lasted.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Describe it.</p>
<p><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp; One has 
described it well&mdash;Florentius of Buda.&nbsp; I can only 
repeat a few of his words:&mdash;&ldquo;On the appointed day, 
Hunyadi, with two hundred vessels, attacked the Turkish flotilla 
in front, whilst Szilagy, with forty vessels, filled with the men
of Belgrade, assailed it in the rear; striving for the same 
object, they sunk many of the Turkish vessels, captured 
seventy-four, burnt many, and utterly annihilated the whole 
fleet.&nbsp; After this victory, Hunyadi, with his army, entered 
Belgrade, to the great joy of the Magyars.&nbsp; But though the 
force of Mahomed upon the water was destroyed, that upon the land
remained entire; and with this, during six days and nights, he 
attacked the city without intermission, destroying its walls in 
many parts.&nbsp; His last and most desperate assault was made on
the 21st day of July.&nbsp; Twice did the Turks gain possession 
of the outer town, and twice was it retaken with indescribable 
slaughter.&nbsp; The next day the combat raged without ceasing 
till mid-day, when the Turks were again beaten out of the town, 
and pursued by the Magyars to their camp.&nbsp; There the combat 
was renewed, both sides displaying the greatest obstinacy, until 
Mahomed received a great wound over his left eye.&nbsp; The Turks
then, turning their faces, fled, leaving behind them three 
hundred cannon in the hands of the Christians, and more than 
twenty-four thousand slain on the field of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; After that battle, I suppose Hunyadi 
enjoyed his triumphs in peace?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In the deepest, for he shortly 
died.&nbsp; His great soul quitted his body, which was exhausted 
by almost superhuman exertions, on the 11th of August 1456.&nbsp;
Shortly before he died, according to Florentius, a comet 
appeared, sent, as it would seem, to announce his coming 
end.&nbsp; The whole Christian world mourned his loss.&nbsp; The 
Pope ordered the cardinals to perform a funeral ceremony at Rome 
in his honour.&nbsp; His great enemy himself grieved for him, and
pronounced his finest eulogium.&nbsp; When Mahomed the Second 
heard of his death, he struck his head for some time against the 
ground without speaking.&nbsp; Suddenly he broke silence with 
these words, &ldquo;Notwithstanding he was my enemy, yet do I 
bewail his loss; since the sun has shone in heaven, no Prince had
ever yet such a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What was the name of his Prince?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Laszlo the Fifth; who, though under 
infinite obligations to Hunyadi, was anything but grateful to 
him; for <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>he once consented to a plan which 
was laid to assassinate him, contrived by his mortal enemy Ulrik,
Count of Cilejia; and after Hunyadi&rsquo;s death, caused his 
eldest son, Hunyadi Laszlo, to be executed on a false accusation,
and imprisoned his younger son, Matyas, who, on the death of 
Laszlo, was elected by the Magyars to be their king, on the 24th 
of January 1458.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Was this Matyas a good king?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was Matyas Corvinus a good king?&nbsp;
O young man of Horncastle! he was the best and greatest that 
Hungary ever possessed, and, after his father, the most renowned 
warrior,&mdash;some of our best laws were framed by him.&nbsp; It
was he who organised the Hussar force, and it was he who took 
Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government always send fools to 
represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I really cannot say; but with respect to 
the Hussar force, is it of Hungarian origin?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Its name shows its origin.&nbsp; Huz, 
in Hungarian, is twenty, and the Hussar force is so called 
because it is formed of twentieths.&nbsp; A law was issued, by 
which it was ordered that every Hungarian nobleman, out of every 
twenty dependants, should produce a well-equipped horseman, and 
with him proceed to the field of battle.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why did Matyas capture Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the Emperor Frederick took 
part against him with the King of Poland, who claimed the kingdom
of Hungary for his son, and had also assisted the Turk.&nbsp; He 
captured it in the year 1487, but did not survive his triumph 
long, expiring there in the year 1490.&nbsp; He was so veracious 
a man, that it was said of him, after his death, &ldquo;Truth 
died with Matyas.&rdquo;&nbsp; It might be added, that the glory 
of Hungary departed with him.&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more 
connected with Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word.&nbsp; Did Matyas leave a 
son?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A natural son, Hunyadi John, called so
after the great man.&nbsp; He would have been universally 
acknowledged as King of Hungary but for the illegitimacy of his 
birth.&nbsp; As it was, Ulaszlo, the son of the King of Poland, 
afterwards called Ulaszlo the Second, who claimed Hungary as 
being descended from Albert, was nominated king by a great 
majority of the Magyar electors.&nbsp; Hunyadi John for some time
disputed the throne with him; there was some bloodshed, but 
Hunyadi John eventually submitted, and became the faithful <!-- 
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
227</span>captain of Ulaszlo, notwithstanding that the Turk 
offered to assist him with an army of two hundred thousand 
men.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Go on.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; To what?&nbsp; Tch&eacute; Drak, to 
the Mohacs Veszedelem.&nbsp; Ulaszlo left a son, Lajos the 
Second, born without skin, as it is said, certainly without a 
head.&nbsp; He, contrary to the advice of all his wise 
counsellors&mdash;and amongst them was Batory Stephen, who became
eventually King of Poland&mdash;engaged, with twenty five 
thousand men, at Mohacs, Soliman the Turk, who had an army of two
hundred thousand.&nbsp; Drak! the Magyars were annihilated, King 
Lajos disappeared with his heavy horse and armour in a bog.&nbsp;
We call that battle, which was fought on the 29th of August 1526,
the destruction of Mohacs, but it was the destruction of 
Hungary.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have twice used the word drak; what 
is the meaning of it?&nbsp; Is it Hungarian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; No! it belongs to the mad 
Wallacks.&nbsp; They are a nation of madmen on the other side of 
Transylvania.&nbsp; Their country was formerly a fief of Hungary,
like Moldavia, which is inhabited by the same race, who speak the
same language, and are equally mad.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What language do they speak?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A strange mixture of Latin and 
Sclavonian&mdash;they themselves being a mixed race of Romans and
Sclavonians.&nbsp; Trajan sent certain legions to form military 
colonies in Dacia; and the present Wallacks and Moldavians are, 
to a certain extent, the descendants of the Roman soldiers, who 
married the women of the country.&nbsp; I say to a certain 
extent, for the Sclavonian element, both in blood and language, 
seems to prevail.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And what is drak?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Dragon; which the Wallacks use for 
devil.&nbsp; The term is curious, as it shows that the old Romans
looked upon the dragon as an infernal being.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have been in Wallachia?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I have, and glad I was to get out of 
it.&nbsp; I hate the mad Wallacks.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why do you call them mad?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are always drinking or 
talking.&nbsp; I never saw a Wallachian eating or silent.&nbsp; 
They talk like madmen, and drink like madmen.&nbsp; In drinking 
they use small phials, the contents of which they pour down their
throats.&nbsp; When I first went amongst them I thought the whole
nation was under <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>a course of physic, but the terrible
jabber of their tongues soon undeceived me.&nbsp; Drak was the 
first word I heard on entering Dacia, and the last when I left 
it.&nbsp; The Moldaves, if possible, drink more, and talk more 
than the Wallachians.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It is singular enough that the only 
Moldavian I have known could not speak.&nbsp; I suppose he was 
born dumb.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A Moldavian born dumb!&nbsp; Excuse 
me, the thing is impossible,&mdash;all Moldavians are born 
talking!&nbsp; I have known a Moldavian who could not speak, but 
he was not born dumb.&nbsp; His master, an Armenian, snipped off 
part of his tongue at Adrianople.&nbsp; He drove him mad with his
jabber.&nbsp; He is now in London, where his master has a 
house.&nbsp; I have letters of credit on the house: the clerk 
paid me money in London, the master was absent; the money which 
you received for the horse belonged to that house.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word with respect to Hungarian 
history.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Drak!&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more
about Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk, I suppose, after Mohacs, got 
possession of Hungary?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; The Turk, upon the 
whole, showed great moderation; not so the Austrian.&nbsp; 
Ferdinand the First claimed the crown of Hungary as being the 
cousin of Maria, widow of Lajos; he found too many disposed to 
support him.&nbsp; His claim, however, was resisted by Zapolya 
John, a Hungarian magnate, who caused himself to be elected 
king.&nbsp; Hungary was for a long time devastated by the wars 
between the partisans of Zapolya and Ferdinand.&nbsp; At last 
Zapolya called in the Turk.&nbsp; Soliman behaved generously to 
him, and after his death befriended his young son, and Isabella 
his queen; eventually the Turks became masters of Transylvania 
and the greater part of Hungary.&nbsp; They were not bad masters,
and had many friends in Hungary, especially amongst those of the 
reformed faith, to which I have myself the honour of belonging; 
those of the reformed faith found the Mufti more tolerant than 
the Pope.&nbsp; Many Hungarians went with the Turks to the siege 
of Vienna, whilst Tekeli and his horsemen guarded Hungary for 
them.&nbsp; A gallant enterprise that siege of Vienna; the last 
great effort of the Turk; it failed, and he speedily lost 
Hungary, but he did not sneak from Hungary like a frightened 
hound.&nbsp; His defence of Buda will not be soon forgotten, 
where Apty Basha, the governor, died fighting <!-- page 229--><a 
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>like a lion
in the breach.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a Hungarian would prefer 
Stamboul to Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government always send 
fools to represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have already told you that I cannot 
say.&nbsp; What became of Tekeli?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; When Hungary was lost he retired with 
the Turks into Turkey.&nbsp; Count Renoncourt, in his Memoirs, 
mentions having seen him at Adrianople.&nbsp; The Sultan, in 
consideration of the services which he had rendered to the Moslem
in Hungary, made over the revenues of certain towns and districts
for his subsistence.&nbsp; The Count says that he always went 
armed to the teeth, and was always attended by a young female 
dressed in male attire, who had followed him in his wars, and had
more than once saved his life.&nbsp; His end is wrapped in 
mystery, I&mdash;whose greatest boast, next to being a Hungarian,
is to be of his blood&mdash;know nothing of his end.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Allow me to ask who you are?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Egy szegeny Magyar Nemes ember, a poor
Hungarian nobleman, son of one yet poorer.&nbsp; I was born in 
Transylvania, not far to the west of good Coloscvar.&nbsp; I 
served some time in the Austrian army as a noble Hussar, but am 
now equerry to a great nobleman, to whom I am distantly 
related.&nbsp; In his service I have travelled far and wide, 
buying horses.&nbsp; I have been in Russia and Turkey, and am now
at Horncastle, where I have had the satisfaction to meet with you
and to buy your horse, which is, in truth, a noble brute.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; For a soldier and equerry you seem to 
know a great deal of the history of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; All I know is derived from Florentius 
of Buda, whom we call Budai Ferentz.&nbsp; He was Professor of 
Greek and Latin at the Reformed College of Debreczen, where I was
educated; he wrote a work entitled &ldquo;Magyar Polgari 
Lexicon,&rdquo; Lives of Great Hungarian Citizens.&nbsp; He was 
dead before I was born, but I found his book, when I was a child,
in the solitary home of my father, which stood on the confines of
a puszta, or wilderness, and that book I used to devour in winter
nights when the winds were whistling around the house.&nbsp; Oh! 
how my blood used to glow at the descriptions of Magyar valour, 
and likewise of Turkish; for Florentius has always done justice 
to the Turk.&nbsp; Many a passage similar to this have I got by 
heart; it is connected with the battle on the plain of Rigo, 
which Hunyadi lost:&mdash;&ldquo;The next day, which was Friday, 
as <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>the two armies were drawn up in battle array, a Magyar 
hero riding forth, galloped up and down, challenging the Turks to
single combat.&nbsp; Then came out to meet him the son of a 
renowned bashaw of Asia; rushing upon each other, both broke 
their lances, but the Magyar hero and his horse rolled over upon 
the ground, for the Turks had always the best 
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; O young man of Horncastle! if ever you learn
Hungarian&mdash;and learn it assuredly you will after what I have
told you&mdash;read the book of Florentius of Buda, even if you 
go to Hungary to get it, for you will scarcely find it elsewhere,
and even there with difficulty, for the book has been long out of
print.&nbsp; It describes the actions of the great men of Hungary
down to the middle of the sixteenth century, and besides being 
written in the purest Hungarian, has the merit of having for its 
author a professor of the Reformed College at Debreczen.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I will go to Hungary rather than not read
it.&nbsp; I am glad that the Turk beat the Magyar.&nbsp; When I 
used to read the ballads of Spain I always sided with the Moor 
against the Christian.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; It was a drawn fight after all, for 
the terrible horse of the Turk presently flung his own master, 
whereupon the two champions returned to their respective armies; 
but in the grand conflict which ensued, the Turks beat the 
Magyars, pursuing them till night, and striking them on the necks
with their scymetars.&nbsp; The Turk is a noble fellow; I should 
wish to be a Turk, were I not a Magyar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk always keeps his word, I am 
told.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Which the Christian very seldom does, 
and even the Hungarian does not always.&nbsp; In 1444 Ulaszlo 
made, at Szeged, peace with Amurath for ten years, which he swore
with an oath to keep, but at the instigation of the Pope Julian 
he broke it, and induced his great captain, Hunyadi John, to 
share in the perjury.&nbsp; The consequence was the battle of 
Varna, of the 10th of November, in which Hunyadi was routed, and 
Ulaszlo slain.&nbsp; Did you ever hear his epitaph? it is both 
solemn and edifying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Romulid&aelig; Cannas ego Varnam clade 
notavi;<br />
Discite mortales non temerare fidem:<br />
Me nisi Pontifices jussissent rumpere f&oelig;dus<br />
Non ferret Scythicum Pannonis ora jugum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; said the jockey, starting up from
a doze in <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>which he had been indulging for the 
last hour, his head leaning upon his breast, &ldquo;what is 
that?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not High Dutch; I bargained for High 
Dutch, and I left you speaking what I believed to be High Dutch, 
as it sounded very much like the language of horses, as I have 
been told High Dutch does; but as for what you are speaking now, 
whatever you may call it, it sounds more like the language of 
another kind of animal.&nbsp; I suppose you want to insult me, 
because I was once a dicky-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the 
gentleman was making a quotation in Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latin, was it?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;that 
alters the case.&nbsp; Latin is genteel, and I have sent my 
eldest boy to an academy to learn it.&nbsp; Come, let us hear you
fire away in Latin,&rdquo; he continued, proceeding to re-light 
his pipe, which, before going to sleep, he had laid on the 
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to follow the discourse in Latin,&rdquo; 
said the Hungarian, in very bad English, &ldquo;I can oblige you;
I learned to speak very good Latin in the college of 
Debreczen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than I have 
done in the colleges where I have been; in any little 
conversation which we may yet have, I wish you would use 
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, taking a whiff, 
&ldquo;make your conversation as short as possible, whether in 
Latin or Dutch, for, to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of 
merely playing listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying you had been in Russia,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;I believe the Russians are part of the Sclavonian 
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Yes, part of the great Sclavonian 
family; one of the most numerous races in the world.&nbsp; The 
Russians themselves are very numerous: would that the Magyars 
could boast of the fifth part of their number!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What is the number of the Magyars?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Barely four millions.&nbsp; We came a 
tribe of Tartars into Europe, and settled down amongst 
Sclavonians, whom we conquered, but who never coalesced with 
us.&nbsp; The Austrian at present plays in Pannonia the 
Sclavonian against us, and us against the Sclavonian; but the 
downfall of the Austrian is at hand; they, like us, are not a 
numerous people.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who will bring about his downfall?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The Russian.&nbsp; The Rysckie Tsar 
will lead his people forth, all the Sclavonians will join him, he
will conquer all before him.</p>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Are the Russians good 
soldiers?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are stubborn and unflinching to 
an astonishing degree, and their fidelity to their Tsar is quite 
admirable.&nbsp; See how the Russians behaved at Plescova, in 
Livonia, in the old time, against our great Batory Stephen; they 
defended the place till it was a heap of rubbish; and mark how 
they behaved after they had been made prisoners.&nbsp; Stephen 
offered them two alternatives:&mdash;to enter into his service, 
in which they would have good pay, clothing, and fair treatment; 
or to be allowed to return to Russia.&nbsp; Without the slightest
hesitation they, to a man, chose the latter, though well aware 
that their beloved Tsar, the cruel Ivan Basilowits, would put 
them all to death, amidst tortures the most horrible, for not 
doing what was impossible&mdash;preserving the town.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You speak Russian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A little.&nbsp; I was born in the 
vicinity of a Sclavonian tribe; the servants of our house were 
Sclavonians, and I early acquired something of their language, 
which differs not much from that of Russia; when in that country 
I quickly understood what was said.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have the Russians any literature?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Doubtless; but I am not acquainted 
with it, as I do not read their language; but I know something of
their popular tales, to which I used to listen in their 
izbushkas; a principal personage in these is a creation quite 
original&mdash;called Baba Yaga.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who is Baba Yaga?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A female phantom, who is described as 
hurrying along the puszta, or steppe, in a mortar, pounding with 
a pestle at a tremendous rate, and leaving a long trace on the 
ground behind her with her tongue, which is three yards long, and
with which she seizes any men and horses coming in her way, 
swallowing them down into her capacious belly.&nbsp; She has 
several daughters, very handsome, and with plenty of money; happy
the young Mujik who catches and marries one of them, for they 
make excellent wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the information 
you have afforded me: this is rather poor wine,&rdquo; I 
observed, as I poured out a glass&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you have
better wine in Hungary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have better wine in Hungary.&nbsp; First of all
there is Tokay, the most celebrated in the world, though I 
confess I prefer the wine of Eger&mdash;Tokay is too 
sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;Have you ever been at Tokay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of place is Tokay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small town situated on the Tyzza, a rapid river 
descending from the north; the Tokay Mountain is just behind the 
town, which stands on the right bank.&nbsp; The top of the 
mountain is called Kopacs Teto, or the bald tip; the hill is so 
steep that during thunderstorms pieces of it frequently fall down
upon the roofs of the houses.&nbsp; It was planted with vines by 
King Lajos, who ascended the throne in the year 1342.&nbsp; The 
best wine called Tokay is, however, not made at Tokay, but at 
Kassau, two leagues farther into the Carpathians, of which Tokay 
is a spur.&nbsp; If you wish to drink the best Tokay, you must go
to Vienna, to which place all the prime is sent.&nbsp; For the 
third time I ask you, O young man of Horncastle! why does your 
Government always send fools to represent it at 
Vienna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the third time I tell you, O son of Almus! that
I cannot say; perhaps, however, to drink the sweet Tokay wine; 
fools, you know, always like sweet things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;it must be so, 
and when I return to Hungary, I will state to my countrymen your 
explanation of a circumstance which has frequently caused them 
great perplexity.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a clever people, and 
have a deep meaning in all they do.&nbsp; What a vision of deep 
policy opens itself to my view: they do not send their fool to 
Vienna in order to gape at processions, and to bow and scrape at 
a base Papist court, but to drink at the great dinners the 
celebrated Tokay of Hungary, which the Hungarians, though they do
not drink it, are very proud of, and by doing so to intimate the 
sympathy which the English entertain for their fellow 
religionists of Hungary.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a deep 
people.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<p>THE HORNCASTLE WELCOME&mdash;TZERNEBOCK AND BIELEBOCK.</p>
<p>The pipe of the Hungarian had, for some time past, exhibited 
considerable symptoms of exhaustion, little or no ruttling having
been heard in the tube, and scarcely a particle of smoke, <!-- 
page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
234</span>drawn through the syphon, having been emitted from the 
lips of the tall possessor.&nbsp; He now rose from his seat, and 
going to a corner of the room, placed his pipe against the wall, 
then striding up and down the room, he cracked his fingers 
several times, exclaiming, in a half-musing manner, &ldquo;Oh, 
the deep nation, which, in order to display its sympathy for 
Hungary, sends its fool to Vienna to drink the sweet wine of 
Tokay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jockey, having looked for some time at the tall figure 
with evident approbation, winked at me with that brilliant eye of
his on which there was no speck, saying, &ldquo;Did you ever see 
a taller fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a finer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another question,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;which I am not so willing to answer; however, as I am fond
of truth, and scorn to flatter, I will take the liberty of saying
that I think I have seen a finer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A finer! where?&rdquo; said the jockey; whilst the 
Hungarian, who appeared to understand what we said, stood still, 
and looked full at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst a strange set of people,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;whom if I were to name, you would, I dare say, only laugh 
at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be they?&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
don&rsquo;t be ashamed; I have occasionally kept queerish company
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people whom we call gypsies,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;whom the Germans call Zigeuner, and who call themselves 
Romany chals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zigeuner!&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;by 
Isten!&nbsp; I do know those people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romany chals!&rdquo; said the jockey; 
&ldquo;whew!&nbsp; I begin to smell a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by smelling a rat?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a crown,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;that you be the young chap what certain folks call 
&lsquo;The Romany Rye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how came you to know that 
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not you he?&rdquo; said the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I certainly have been called by that 
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have sworn it,&rdquo; said the jockey; then 
rising from his chair, he laid his pipe on the table, took a 
large hand-bell which stood on a sideboard, and going to the 
door, opened it, and commenced ringing in a most tremendous 
manner on the staircase.&nbsp; The noise presently brought up a 
waiter, to whom the jockey vociferated, &ldquo;Go to your master,
and tell him to <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>send immediately three bottles of 
champagne, of the pink kind, mind you, which is twelve guineas a 
dozen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The waiter hurried away, and the jockey 
resumed his seat and his pipe.&nbsp; I sat in silent astonishment
till the waiter returned with a basket containing the wine, 
which, with three long glasses, he placed on the table.&nbsp; The
jockey then got up, and going to a large bow-window at the end of
the room, which looked into a courtyard, peeped out; then saying,
&ldquo;The coast is clear,&rdquo; he shut down the principal 
sash, which was open for the sake of the air, and taking up a 
bottle of the champagne, he placed another in the hands of the 
Hungarian, to whom he said something in private.&nbsp; The 
latter, who seemed to understand him, answered by a nod.&nbsp; 
The two then going to the end of the table fronting the window, 
and about eight paces from it, stood before it holding the 
bottles by their necks; suddenly the jockey lifted up his 
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not mad 
enough to fling that bottle through the window?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the Romany Rye; here&rsquo;s to the sweet 
master,&rdquo; said the jockey, dashing the bottle through a pane
in so neat a manner that scarcely a particle of glass fell into 
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eljen edes csigany ur&mdash;eljen gul eray!&rdquo; said
the Hungarian, swinging round his bottle and discharging it at 
the window; but, either not possessing the jockey&rsquo;s 
accuracy of aim, or reckless of consequences, he flung his bottle
so that it struck against part of the wooden setting of the 
panes, breaking along with the wood and itself three or four 
panes to pieces.&nbsp; The crash was horrid, and wine and 
particles of glass flew back into the room, to the no small 
danger of its inmates.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think of 
that?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;were you ever so honoured 
before?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Honoured!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;God preserve me in future from such honour;&rdquo; and I 
put my finger to my cheek, which was slightly hurt by a particle 
of the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we of the cofrady
honour great men at Horncastle,&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What, you are hurt! never mind; all the better; your 
scratch shows that you are the body the compliment was paid 
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what are you going to do with the 
other bottle?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do with it!&rdquo; said
the jockey, &ldquo;why, drink it, cosily and comfortably, whilst 
holding a little quiet talk.&nbsp; The Romany Rye at Horncastle, 
what an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will the master of the house say to all this 
damage which you have caused him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your master say, William?&rdquo; said the 
jockey to <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>the waiter, who had witnessed the 
singular scene just described without exhibiting the slightest 
mark of surprise.&nbsp; William smiled, and slightly shrugging 
his shoulders, replied, &ldquo;Very little, I dare say, sir; this
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the first time your honour has done a thing of 
this kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor will it be the first time that
I shall have paid for it,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;well, I 
shall have never paid for a certain item in the bill with more 
pleasure than I shall pay for it now.&nbsp; Come, William, draw 
the cork, and let us taste the pink champagne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter drew the cork, and filled the glasses with a pinky 
liquor, which bubbled, hissed, and foamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do 
you like it?&rdquo; said the jockey, after I had imitated the 
example of my companions by despatching my portion at a 
draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful wine,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have 
never tasted champagne before, though I have frequently heard it 
praised; it more than answers my expectations; but, I confess, I 
should not wish to be obliged to drink it every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;for everyday 
drinking give me a glass of old port, or . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of hard old ale,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;which, 
according to my mind, is better than all the wine in the 
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, Romany Rye,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;just my own opinion; now, William, make yourself 
scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter withdrew, and I said to the jockey, &ldquo;How did 
you become acquainted with the Romany chals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first became acquainted with them,&rdquo; said the 
jockey, &ldquo;when I lived with old Fulcher the basket-maker, 
who took me up when I was adrift upon the world; I do not mean 
the present Fulcher, who is likewise called old Fulcher, but his 
father, who has been dead this many a year; while living with him
in the caravan, I frequently met them in the green lanes, and of 
latter years I have had occasional dealings with them in the 
horse line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gypsies have mentioned me to you?&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;and not only
those of these parts; why, there&rsquo;s scarcely a part of 
England in which I have not heard the name of the Romany Rye 
mentioned by these people.&nbsp; The power you have over them is 
wonderful; that is, I should have thought it wonderful, had they 
not more than once told me the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the cause?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I am 
sure I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;The cause is this,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;they never heard a bad word proceed from your mouth, and 
never knew you do a bad thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a singular people,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a singular language they have got,&rdquo; said
the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few words,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;they 
were always chary in teaching me any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were vary sherry to me too,&rdquo; said the 
Hungarian, speaking in broken English; &ldquo;I only could learn 
from them half-a-dozen words, for example, gul eray, which, in 
the czigany of my country, means sweet gentleman; or edes ur in 
my own Magyar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gudlo Rye, in the Romany of mine, means a sugar&rsquo;d
gentleman,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;then there are gypsies in your 
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said the Hungarian, speaking German, 
&ldquo;and in Russia and Turkey too; and wherever they are found,
they are alike in their ways and language.&nbsp; Oh, they are a 
strange race, and how little known.&nbsp; I know little of them, 
but enough to say that one horse-load of nonsense has been 
written about them; there is one Valter Scott . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind what you say about him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he 
is our grand authority in matters of philology and 
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty philologist,&rdquo; said the Hungarian, 
&ldquo;who makes the gypsies speak Roth-Welsch, the dialect of 
thieves; a pretty historian, who couples together Thor and 
Tzernebock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he do that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his conceited romance of Ivanhoe, he couples Thor 
and Tzernebock together, and calls them gods of the heathen 
Saxons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Thur or Thor was certainly 
a god of the heathen Saxons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;but why couple 
him with Tzernebock?&nbsp; Tzernebock was a word which your 
Valter had picked up somewhere without knowing the meaning.&nbsp;
Tzernebock was no god of the Saxons, but one of the gods of the 
Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.&nbsp; The Sclaves 
had two grand gods to whom they sacrificed, Tzernebock and 
Bielebock: that is, the black and white gods, who represented the
powers of dark and light.&nbsp; They were overturned by Waldemar 
the Dane, the great enemy of the Sclaves; the account of <!-- 
page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>whose wars you will find in one fine old book, written 
by Saxo Gramaticus, which I read in the library of the college of
Debreczen.&nbsp; The Sclaves at one time were masters of all the 
southern shore of the Baltic, where their descendants are still 
to be found, though they have lost their language, and call 
themselves Germans; but the word Zernevitz, near Dantzic, still 
attests that the Sclavic language was once common in those 
parts.&nbsp; Zernevitz means the thing of blackness, as 
Tzernebock means the god of blackness.&nbsp; Prussia itself 
merely means, in Sclavish, Lower Russia.&nbsp; There is scarcely 
a race or language in the world more extended than the 
Sclavic.&nbsp; On the other side of the Donau you will find the 
Sclaves and their language.&nbsp; Czernavoda is Sclavic, and 
means black water; in Turkish, kara su; even as Tzernebock means 
black god; and Belgrade, or Belograd, means the white town; even 
as Bielebock, or Bielebog, means the white god.&nbsp; Oh! he is 
one great ignorant, that Valter.&nbsp; He is going, they say, to 
write one history about Napoleon.&nbsp; I do hope that in his 
history he will couple his Thor and Tzernebock together.&nbsp; By
my God! it would be good diversion that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter Scott appears to be no particular favourite of 
yours,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;I hate him
for his slavish principles.&nbsp; He wishes to see absolute power
restored in this country, and Popery also; and I hate him because
. . . what do you think?&nbsp; In one of his novels, published a 
few months ago, he has the insolence to insult Hungary in the 
person of one of her sons.&nbsp; He makes his great braggart, 
C&oelig;ur de Lion, fling a Magyar over his head.&nbsp; Ha! it 
was well for Richard that he never felt the gripe of a 
Hungarian.&nbsp; I wish the braggart could have felt the gripe of
me, who am &lsquo;a&rsquo; Magyarok k&ouml;zt legkissebb,&rsquo; 
the least among the Magyars.&nbsp; I do hate that Scott, and all 
his vile gang of Lowlanders and Highlanders.&nbsp; The black 
corps, the fekete regiment of Matyjas Hunyadi, was worth all the 
Scots, high or low, that ever pretended to be soldiers; and would
have sent them all headlong into the Black Sea, had they dared to
confront it on its shores; but why be angry with an ignorant, who
couples together Thor and Tzernebock?&nbsp; Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read his novels?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I read them now and then.&nbsp; I do not speak 
much English, but I can read it well, and I have read some of his
<!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
239</span>romances, and mean to read his Napoleon, in the hope of
finding Thor and Tzernebock coupled together in it, as in his 
high-flying Ivanhoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;no more Dutch, 
whether high or low.&nbsp; I am tired of it; unless we can have 
some English, I am off to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very glad to hear some English,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;especially from your mouth.&nbsp; Several things which 
you have mentioned have awakened my curiosity.&nbsp; Suppose you 
give us your history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My history?&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;A rum 
idea! however, lest conversation should lag, I&rsquo;ll give it 
you.&nbsp; First of all, however, a glass of champagne to 
each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we had each taken a glass of champagne, the jockey 
commenced his history.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<p>THE JOCKEY&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;THIEVES&rsquo; 
LATIN&mdash;LIBERTIES WITH COIN&mdash;THE SMASHER IN 
PRISON&mdash;OLD FULCHER&mdash;EVERY ONE HAS HIS 
GIFT&mdash;FASHION OF THE ENGLISH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather was a shorter, and my father was a 
smasher; the one was scragg&rsquo;d, and the other 
lagg&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I here interrupted the jockey by observing that his discourse 
was, for the greater part, unintelligible to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand much English,&rdquo; said the 
Hungarian, who, having replenished and resumed his mighty pipe, 
was now smoking away; &ldquo;but, by Isten, I believe it is the 
gibberish which that great ignorant Valter Scott puts into the 
mouth of the folks he calls gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like it, I confess,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;though this sounds more genuine than his dialect, which he
picked up out of the canting vocabulary at the end of the 
&lsquo;English Rogue,&rsquo; a book which, however despised, was 
written by a remarkable genius.&nbsp; What do you call the speech
you were using?&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the 
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latin,&rdquo; said the jockey, very coolly; &ldquo;that
is, that dialect of it which is used by the light-fingered 
gentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;it is 
what the Germans <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>call Roth-Welsch: they call it so 
because there are a great many Latin words in it, introduced by 
the priests, who, at the time of the Reformation, being too lazy 
to work, and too stupid to preach, joined the bands of thieves 
and robbers who prowled about the country.&nbsp; Italy, as you 
are aware, is called by the Germans Welschland, or the land of 
the Welschers; and I may add that Wallachia derives its name from
a colony of Welschers which Trajan sent there.&nbsp; Welsch and 
Wallack being one and the same word, and tantamount to 
Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but why
was Italy termed Welschland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I can tell you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it 
was called so because the original inhabitants were a Cimbric 
tribe, who were called Gwyltiad, that is, a race of wild people, 
living in coverts, who were of the same blood, and spoke the same
language as the present inhabitants of Wales.&nbsp; Welsh seems 
merely a modification of Gwyltiad.&nbsp; Pray continue your 
history,&rdquo; said I to the jockey, &ldquo;only please to do so
in a language which we can understand, and first of all interpret
the sentence with which you began it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that my grandfather was a shorter,&rdquo; 
said the jockey, &ldquo;by which is meant a gentleman who 
shortens or reduces the current coin of these realms, for which 
practice he was scragg&rsquo;d, that is, hung by the scrag of the
neck.&nbsp; And when I said that my father was a smasher, I meant
one who passes forged notes, thereby doing his best to smash the 
Bank of England; by being lagg&rsquo;d, I meant he was laid fast,
that is, had a chain put round his leg and then 
transported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your explanations are perfectly satisfactory,&rdquo; 
said I; &ldquo;the three first words are metaphorical, and the 
fourth, lagg&rsquo;d, is the old genuine Norse term, lagda, which
signifies laid, whether in durance, or in bed, has nothing to do 
with the matter.&nbsp; What you have told me confirms me in an 
opinion which I have long entertained, that thieves&rsquo; Latin 
is a strange, mysterious speech, formed of metaphorical terms, 
and words derived from various ancient languages.&nbsp; Pray tell
me, now, how the gentleman, your grandfather, contrived to 
shorten the coin of these realms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;but I 
have one thing to beg of you, which is, that when I have once 
begun my history you will not interrupt me with questions; I 
don&rsquo;t like <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>them, they stops one, and puts one 
out of one&rsquo;s tale, and are not wanted; for anything which I
think can&rsquo;t be understood, I should myself explain, without
being asked.&nbsp; My grandfather reduced or shortened the coin 
of this country by three processes.&nbsp; By aquafortis, by 
clipping, and by filing.&nbsp; Filing and clipping he employed in
reducing all kinds of coin, whether gold or silver; but 
aquafortis he used merely in reducing gold coin, whether guineas,
jacobuses, or Portugal pieces, otherwise called moidores, which 
were at one time as current as guineas.&nbsp; By laying a guinea 
in aquafortis for twelve hours he could filch from it to the 
value of ninepence, and by letting it remain there for 
twenty-four, to the value of eighteenpence, the aquafortis eating
the gold away, and leaving it like a sediment in the 
vessel.&nbsp; He was generally satisfied with taking the value of
ninepence from a guinea, of eighteenpence from a jacobus or 
moidore, or half-a-crown from a broad Spanish piece, whether he 
reduced them by aquafortis, filing, or clipping.&nbsp; From a 
five-shilling piece, which is called a bull in Latin, because it 
is round like a bull&rsquo;s head, he would file or clip to the 
value of fivepence, and from lesser coin in proportion.&nbsp; He 
was connected with a numerous gang, or set, of people, who had 
given up their minds and talents entirely to 
shortening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;How 
singular,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is the fall and debasement of 
words!&nbsp; You talk of a gang, or set, of shorters: you are, 
perhaps, not aware that gang and set were, a thousand years ago, 
only connected with the great and Divine; they are ancient Norse 
words, which may be found in the heroic poems of the north, and 
in the Edda, a collection of mythologic and heroic songs.&nbsp; 
In these poems we read that such and such a king invaded Norway 
with a gang of heroes; or so and so, for example, Erik Bloodaxe 
was admitted to the set of gods; but at present gang and set are 
merely applied to the vilest of the vile, and the lowest of the 
low&mdash;we say a gang of thieves and shorters, or a set of 
authors.&nbsp; How touching is this debasement of words in the 
course of time! it puts me in mind of the decay of old houses and
names.&nbsp; I have known a Mortimer who was a hedger and 
ditcher, a Berners who was born in a workhouse, and a descendant 
of the De Burghs who bore the falcon, mending old kettles, and 
making horse and pony shoes in a dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd enough,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;but you were
saying you knew one Berners&mdash;man or woman?&nbsp; I would 
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might her Christian name be?&rdquo; said the 
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not to be mentioned lightly,&rdquo; said I, with 
a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it were Isopel,&rdquo; said
the jockey, with an arch glance of his one brilliant eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Isopel,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;did you know 
Isopel Berners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and have reason to know her,&rdquo; said the 
jockey, putting his hand into his left waistcoat-pocket, as if to
feel for something, &ldquo;for she gave me what I believe few men
could do&mdash;a most confounded wapping.&nbsp; But now, Mr. 
Romany Rye, I have again to tell you that I don&rsquo;t like to 
be interrupted when I&rsquo;m speaking, and to add that if you 
break in upon me a third time, you and I shall 
quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed with your story,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I 
will not interrupt you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was 
I?&nbsp; Oh, with a set of people who had given up their minds to
shortening!&nbsp; Reducing the coin, though rather a lucrative, 
was a very dangerous trade.&nbsp; Coin filed felt rough to the 
touch; coin clipped could be easily detected by the eye; and as 
for coin reduced by aquafortis, it was generally so discoloured 
that, unless a great deal of pains was used to polish it, people 
were apt to stare at it in a strange manner, and to say, 
&lsquo;What have they been doing to this here gold?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
My grandfather, as I said before, was connected with a gang of 
shorters, and sometimes shortened money, and at other times 
passed off what had been shortened by other gentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing off what had been shortened by others was his 
ruin; for once, in trying to pass off a broad piece which had 
been laid in aquafortis for four-and-twenty hours, and was very 
black, not having been properly rectified, he was stopped and 
searched, and other reduced coins being found about him, and in 
his lodgings, he was committed to prison, tried, and 
executed.&nbsp; He was offered his life, provided he would betray
his comrades; but he told the big-wigs who wanted him to do so, 
that he would see them farther first, and died at Tyburn, amidst 
the cheers of the populace, leaving my grandmother and father, to
whom he had always been a kind husband and parent&mdash;for, 
setting aside the crime for which he suffered, he was a moral 
man; leaving them, I say, to bewail his irreparable loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis said that misfortune never comes alone; this
is, however, not always the case.&nbsp; Shortly after my 
grandfather&rsquo;s <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>misfortune, as my grandmother and 
her son were living in great misery in Spitalfields, her only 
relation&mdash;a brother from whom she had been estranged some 
years, on account of her marriage with my grandfather, who had 
been in an inferior station to herself&mdash;died, leaving all 
his property to her and the child.&nbsp; This property consisted 
of a farm of about a hundred acres, with its stock, and some 
money besides.&nbsp; My grandmother, who knew something of 
business, instantly went into the country, where she farmed the 
property for her own benefit and that of her son, to whom she 
gave an education suitable to a person in his condition, till he 
was old enough to manage the farm himself.&nbsp; Shortly after 
the young man came of age, my grandmother died, and my father, in
about a year, married the daughter of a farmer, from whom he 
expected some little fortune, but who very much deceived him, 
becoming a bankrupt almost immediately after the marriage of his 
daughter, and himself and family going to the workhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, however, made my father an excellent wife; 
and if my father in the long run did not do well, it was no fault
of hers.&nbsp; My father was not a bad man by nature; he was of 
an easy, generous temper, the most unfortunate temper, 
by-the-bye, for success in this life that any person can be 
possessed of, as those who have it are almost sure to be made 
dupes of by the designing.&nbsp; But, though easy and generous, 
he was anything but a fool; he had a quick and witty tongue of 
his own when he chose to exert it, and woe be to those who 
insulted him openly, for there was not a better boxer in the 
whole country round.&nbsp; My parents were married several years 
before I came into the world, who was their first and only 
child.&nbsp; I may be called an unfortunate creature; I was born 
with this beam or scale on my left eye, which does not allow me 
to see with it; and though I can see tolerably sharply with the 
other, indeed more than most people can with both of theirs, it 
is a great misfortune not to have two eyes like other 
people.&nbsp; Moreover, setting aside the affair of my eye, I had
a very ugly countenance; my mouth being slightly wrung aside, and
my complexion rather swarthy.&nbsp; In fact, I looked so queer 
that the gossips and neighbours, when they first saw me, swore I 
was a changeling&mdash;perhaps it would have been well if I had 
never been born; for my poor father, who had been particularly 
anxious to have a son, no sooner saw me than he turned away, went
to the neighbouring town, and did not return for two days.&nbsp; 
I am by <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>no means certain that I was not the 
cause of his ruin, for till I came into the world he was fond of 
his home, and attended much to business, but afterwards he went 
frequently into company, and did not seem to care much about his 
affairs: he was, however, a kind man, and when his wife gave him 
advice never struck her, nor do I ever remember that he kicked me
when I came in his way, or so much as cursed my ugly face, though
it was easy to see that he didn&rsquo;t over-like me.&nbsp; When 
I was six years old I was sent to the village school, where I was
soon booked for a dunce, because the master found it impossible 
to teach me either to read or write.&nbsp; Before I had been at 
school two years, however, I had beaten boys four years older 
than myself, and could fling a stone with my left hand (for if I 
am right-eyed I am left-handed) higher and farther than any one 
in the parish.&nbsp; Moreover, no boy could equal me at riding, 
and no people ride so well or desperately as boys.&nbsp; I could 
ride a donkey&mdash;a thing far more difficult to ride than a 
horse&mdash;at full gallop over hedges and ditches, seated or 
rather floating upon his hinder part,&mdash;so though anything 
but clever, as this here Romany Rye would say, I was yet able to 
do things which few other people could do.&nbsp; By the time I 
was ten my father&rsquo;s affairs had got into a very desperate 
condition, for he had taken to gambling and horse-racing, and, 
being unsuccessful, had sold his stock, mortgaged his estate, and
incurred very serious debts.&nbsp; The upshot was, that within a 
little time all he had was seized, himself imprisoned, and my 
mother and myself put into a cottage belonging to the parish, 
which, being very cold and damp, was the cause of her catching a 
fever, which speedily carried her off.&nbsp; I was then bound 
apprentice to a farmer, in whose service I underwent much coarse 
treatment, cold, and hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After lying in prison near two years, my father was 
liberated by an Act for the benefit of insolvent debtors; he was 
then lost sight of for some time; at last, however, he made his 
appearance in the neighbourhood dressed like a gentleman, and 
seemingly possessed of plenty of money.&nbsp; He came to see me, 
took me into a field, and asked me how I was getting on.&nbsp; I 
told him I was dreadfully used, and begged him to take me away 
with him; he refused, and told me to be satisfied with my 
condition, for that he could do nothing for me.&nbsp; I had a 
great love for my father, and likewise a great admiration for him
on account of his character as a boxer, the only character which 
boys in <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>general regard, so I wished much to 
be with him, independently of the dog&rsquo;s life I was leading 
where I was; I therefore said if he would not take me with him, I
would follow him; he replied that I must do no such thing, for 
that if I did it would be my ruin.&nbsp; I asked him what he 
meant, but he made no reply, only saying that he would go and 
speak to the farmer.&nbsp; Then taking me with him, he went to 
the farmer, and in a very civil manner said that he understood I 
had not been very kindly treated by him, but he hoped that in 
future I should be used better.&nbsp; The farmer answered in a 
surly tone, that I had been only too well treated, for that I was
a worthless young scoundrel; high words ensued, and the farmer, 
forgetting the kind of man he had to deal with, checked him with 
my grandsire&rsquo;s misfortune, and said he deserved to be 
hanged like his father.&nbsp; In a moment my father knocked him 
down, and on his getting up, gave him a terrible beating, then 
taking me by the hand he hastened away; as we were going down a 
lane he said we were now both done for: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care
a straw for that, father,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;provided I be 
with you.&rsquo;&nbsp; My father took me to the neighbouring 
town, and going into the yard of a small inn, he ordered out a 
pony and light cart which belonged to him, then paying his bill, 
he told me to mount upon the seat, and getting up, drove away 
like lightning; we drove for at least six hours without stopping,
till we came to a cottage by the side of a heath; we put the pony
and cart into a shed, and went into the cottage, my father 
unlocking the door with a key which he took out of his pocket; 
there was nobody in the cottage when we arrived, but shortly 
after there came a man and woman, and then some more people, and 
by ten o&rsquo;clock at night there were a dozen of us in the 
cottage.&nbsp; The people were companions of my father.&nbsp; My 
father began talking to them in Latin, but I did not understand 
much of the discourse, though I believe it was about myself, as 
their eyes were frequently turned to me.&nbsp; Some objections 
appeared to be made to what he said; however, all at last seemed 
to be settled, and we all sat down to some food.&nbsp; After that
all the people got up and went away, with the exception of the 
woman, who remained with my father and me.&nbsp; The next day my 
father also departed, leaving me with the woman, telling me 
before he went that she would teach me some things which it 
behoved me to know.&nbsp; I remained with her in the cottage 
upwards of a week; several of those who had been there coming and
going.&nbsp; <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>The woman, after making me take an 
oath to be faithful, told me that the people whom I had seen were
a gang who got their livelihood by passing forged notes, and that
my father was a principal man amongst them, adding, that I must 
do my best to assist them.&nbsp; I was a poor ignorant child at 
that time, and I made no objection, thinking that whatever my 
father did must be right; the woman then gave me some 
instructions in the smasher&rsquo;s dialect of the Latin 
language.&nbsp; I made great progress, because, for the first 
time in my life, I paid great attention to my lessons.&nbsp; At 
last my father returned, and, after some conversation with the 
woman, took me away in his cart.&nbsp; I shall be very short 
about what happened to my father and myself during two 
years.&nbsp; My father did his best to smash the Bank of England 
by passing forged notes, and I did my best to assist him.&nbsp; 
We attended races and fairs in all kinds of disguises; my father 
was a first-rate hand at a disguise, and could appear of all 
ages, from twenty to fourscore; he was, however, grabbed at 
last.&nbsp; He had said, as I have told you, that he should be my
ruin, but I was the cause of his, and all owing to the misfortune
of this here eye of mine.&nbsp; We came to this very place of 
Horncastle, where my father purchased two horses of a young man, 
paying for them with three forged notes, purporting to be Bank of
Englanders, of fifty pounds each, and got the young man to change
another of the like amount; he at that time appeared as a 
respectable dealer, and I as his son, as I really was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we had got the horses, we conveyed them to 
one of the places of call belonging to our gang, of which there 
were several.&nbsp; There they were delivered into the hands of 
one of our companions, who speedily sold them in a distant part 
of the country.&nbsp; The sum which they fetched&mdash;for the 
gang kept very regular accounts&mdash;formed an important item on
the next day of sharing, of which there were twelve in the 
year.&nbsp; The young man whom my father had paid for the horses 
with his smashing notes, was soon in trouble about them, and ran 
some risk, as I have heard, of being executed; but he bore a good
character, told a plain story, and, above all, had friends, and 
was admitted to bail; to one of his friends he described my 
father and myself.&nbsp; This person happened to be at an inn in 
Yorkshire, where my father, disguised as a Quaker, attempted to 
pass a forged note.&nbsp; The note was shown to this individual, 
who pronounced it a forgery, it being exactly similar to those 
<!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
247</span>for which the young man had been in trouble, and which 
he had seen.&nbsp; My father, however, being supposed a 
respectable man, because he was dressed as a Quaker&mdash;the 
very reason, by the-bye, why anybody who knew aught of the 
Quakers would have suspected him to be a rogue&mdash;would have 
been let go, had I not made my appearance, dressed as his 
footboy.&nbsp; The friend of the young man looked at my eye, and 
seized hold of my father, who made a desperate resistance, I 
assisting him, as in duty bound.&nbsp; Being, however, 
overpowered by numbers, he bade me by a look, and a word or two 
in Latin, to make myself scarce.&nbsp; Though my heart was fit to
break, I obeyed my father, who was speedily committed.&nbsp; I 
followed him to the county town in which he was lodged, where 
shortly after I saw him tried, convicted, and condemned.&nbsp; I 
then, having made friends with the jailor&rsquo;s wife, visited 
him in his cell, where I found him very much cast down.&nbsp; He 
said that my mother had appeared to him in a dream, and talked to
him about a resurrection and Christ Jesus; there was a Bible 
before him, and he told me the chaplain had just been praying 
with him.&nbsp; He reproached himself much, saying, he was afraid
he had been my ruin, by teaching me bad habits.&nbsp; I told him 
not to say any such thing, for that I had been the cause of his, 
owing to the misfortune of my eye.&nbsp; He begged me to give 
over all unlawful pursuits, saying, that if persisted in, they 
were sure of bringing a person to destruction.&nbsp; I advised 
him to try and make his escape: proposing, that when the turnkey 
came to let me out, he should knock him down, and fight his way 
out, offering to assist him; showing him a small saw, with which 
one of our companions, who was in the neighbourhood, had provided
me, and with which he could have cut through his fetters in five 
minutes; but he told me he had no wish to escape, and was quite 
willing to die.&nbsp; I was rather hard at that time; I am not 
very soft now; and I felt rather ashamed of my father&rsquo;s 
want of what I called spirit.&nbsp; He was not executed after 
all; for the chaplain, who was connected with a great family, 
stood his friend, and got his sentence commuted, as they call it,
to transportation; and in order to make the matter easy, he 
induced my father to make some valuable disclosures with respect 
to the smashers&rsquo; system.&nbsp; I confess that I would have 
been hanged before I would have done so, after having reaped the 
profit of it; that is, I think so now, seated comfortably in my 
inn, with my bottle of champagne <!-- page 248--><a 
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>before 
me.&nbsp; He, however, did not show himself carrion; he would not
betray his companions, who had behaved very handsomely to him, 
having given the son of a lord, a great barrister, not a 
hundred-pound forged bill, but a hundred hard guineas, to plead 
his cause, and another ten, to induce him, after pleading, to put
his hand to his breast, and say that, upon his honour, he 
believed the prisoner at the bar to be an honest and injured 
man.&nbsp; No; I am glad to be able to say that my father did not
show himself exactly carrion, though I could almost have wished 
he had let himself . . .&nbsp; However, I am here with my bottle 
of champagne and the Romany Rye, and he was in his cell, with 
bread and water and the prison chaplain.&nbsp; He took an 
affectionate leave of me before he was sent away, giving me three
out of five guineas, all the money he had left.&nbsp; He was a 
kind man, but not exactly fitted to fill my grandfather&rsquo;s 
shoes.&nbsp; I afterwards learned that he died of fever as he was
being carried across the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the &rsquo;sizes I had made acquaintance with 
old Fulcher.&nbsp; I was in the town on my father&rsquo;s 
account, and he was there on his son&rsquo;s, who, having 
committed a small larceny, was in trouble.&nbsp; Young Fulcher, 
however, unlike my father, got off, though he did not give the 
son of a lord a hundred guineas to speak for him, and ten more to
pledge his sacred honour for his honesty, but gave Counsellor P .
. . one-and-twenty shillings to defend him, who so frightened the
principal evidence, a plain honest farming man, that he flatly 
contradicted what he had first said, and at last acknowledged 
himself to be all the rogues in the world, and, amongst other 
things, a perjured villain.&nbsp; Old Fulcher, before he left the
town with his son,&mdash;and here it will be well to say that he 
and his son left it in a kind of triumph, the base drummer of a 
militia regiment, to whom they had given half-a-crown, beating 
his drum before them&mdash;Old Fulcher, I say, asked me to go and
visit him, telling me where, at such a time, I might find him and
his caravan and family; offering, if I thought fit, to teach me 
basket-making: so, after my father had been sent off, I went and 
found up old Fulcher, and became his apprentice in the 
basket-making line.&nbsp; I stayed with him till the time of his 
death, which happened in about three months, travelling about 
with him and his family, and living in green lanes, where we saw 
gypsies and trampers, and all kinds of strange characters.&nbsp; 
Old Fulcher, besides being an industrious basket-maker <!-- page 
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
249</span>was an out and out thief, as was also his son, and 
indeed every member of his family.&nbsp; They used to make 
baskets during the day, and thieve during a great part of the 
night.&nbsp; I had not been with them twelve hours before old 
Fulcher told me that I must thieve as well as the rest.&nbsp; I 
demurred at first, for I remembered the fate of my father, and 
what he had told me about leaving off bad courses, but soon 
allowed myself to be over-persuaded; more especially as the first
robbery I was asked to do was a fruit robbery.&nbsp; I was to go 
with young Fulcher and steal some fine Morell cherries, which 
grew against a wall in a gentleman&rsquo;s garden; so young 
Fulcher and I went and stole the cherries, one half of which we 
ate, and gave the rest to the old man, who sold them to a 
fruiterer ten miles off from the place where we had stolen 
them.&nbsp; The next night old Fulcher took me out with 
himself.&nbsp; He was a great thief, though in a small way.&nbsp;
He used to say that they were fools who did not always manage to 
keep the rope below their shoulders, by which he meant, that it 
was not advisable to commit a robbery, or do anything which could
bring you to the gallows.&nbsp; He was all for petty larceny, and
knew where to put his hand upon any little thing in England, 
which it was possible to steal.&nbsp; I submit it to the better 
judgment of the Romany Rye, who I see is a great hand for words 
and names, whether he ought not to have been called old Filcher, 
instead of Fulcher.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t give a regular account 
of the larcenies which he committed during the short time I knew 
him, either alone by himself, or with me and his son.&nbsp; I 
shall merely relate the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A melancholy gentleman, who lived a very solitary life,
had a large carp in a shady pond in a meadow close to his house; 
he was exceedingly fond of it, and used to feed it with his own 
hand, the creature being so tame that it would put its snout out 
of the water to be fed when it was whistled to; feeding and 
looking at his carp were the only pleasures the poor melancholy 
gentleman possessed.&nbsp; Old Fulcher&mdash;being in the 
neighbourhood, and having an order from a fishmonger for a large 
fish, which was wanted at a great city dinner, at which His 
Majesty was to be present&mdash;swore he would steal the carp, 
and asked me to go with him.&nbsp; I had heard of the 
gentleman&rsquo;s fondness for his creature, and begged him to 
let it be, advising him to go and steal some other fish; but old 
Fulcher swore, and said he would have the carp, although its <!--
page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
250</span>master should hang himself; I told him he might go by 
himself, but he took his son and stole the carp, which weighed 
seventeen pounds.&nbsp; Old Fulcher got thirty shillings for the 
carp, which I afterwards heard was much admired and relished by 
His Majesty.&nbsp; The master, however, of the carp, on losing 
his favourite, became more melancholy than ever, and in a little 
time hanged himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s sport for one, is 
death to another,&rsquo; I once heard at the village school read 
out of a copy-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the last larceny old Fulcher ever 
committed.&nbsp; He could keep his neck always out of the noose, 
but he could not always keep his leg out of the trap.&nbsp; A few
nights after, having removed to a distance, he went to an osier 
car in order to steal some osiers for his basket-making, for he 
never bought any.&nbsp; I followed a little way behind.&nbsp; Old
Fulcher had frequently stolen osiers out of the car whilst in the
neighbourhood, but during his absence the property, of which the 
car was part, had been let to a young gentleman, a great hand for
preserving game.&nbsp; Old Fulcher had not got far into the car 
before he put his foot into a man-trap.&nbsp; Hearing old Fulcher
shriek, I ran up, and found him in a dreadful condition.&nbsp; 
Putting a large stick which I carried into the jaws of the trap, 
I contrived to prize them open, and get old Fulcher&rsquo;s leg 
out, but the leg was broken.&nbsp; So I ran to the caravan and 
told young Fulcher of what had happened, and he and I went and 
helped his father home.&nbsp; A doctor was sent for, who said 
that it was necessary to take the leg off, but old Fulcher, being
very much afraid of pain, said it should not be taken off, and 
the doctor went away; but after some days, old Fulcher becoming 
worse, ordered the doctor to be sent for, who came and took off 
his leg, but it was then too late, mortification had come on, and
in a little time old Fulcher died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus perished old Fulcher: he was succeeded in his 
business by his son, young Fulcher, who, immediately after the 
death of his father, was called old Fulcher, it being our English
custom to call everybody old as soon as their fathers are buried;
young Fulcher&mdash;I mean he who had been called young, but was 
now old Fulcher&mdash;wanted me to go out and commit larcenies 
with him; but I told him that I would have nothing more to do 
with thieving, having seen the ill effects of it, and that I 
should leave them in the morning.&nbsp; Old Fulcher begged me to 
think better of it, and his mother joined with him.&nbsp; They 
offered, if I would stay, to give me Mary Fulcher <!-- page 
251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>as
a mort, till she and I were old enough to be regularly married, 
she being the daughter of the one and the sister of the 
other.&nbsp; I liked the girl very well, for she had been always 
civil to me, and had a fair complexion and nice red hair, both of
which I like, being a bit of a black myself; but I refused, being
determined to see something more of the world than I could hope 
to do with the Fulchers, and, moreover, to live honestly, which I
could never do along with them.&nbsp; So the next morning I left 
them: I was, as I said before, quite determined upon an honest 
livelihood, and I soon found one.&nbsp; He is a great fool who is
ever dishonest in England.&nbsp; Any person who has any natural 
gift, and everybody has some natural gift, is sure of finding 
encouragement in this noble country of ours, provided he will but
exhibit it.&nbsp; I had not walked more than three miles before I
came to a wonderfully high church steeple, which stood close by 
the road; I looked at the steeple, and going to a heap of smooth 
pebbles which lay by the roadside, I took up some, and then went 
into the churchyard, and placing myself just below the tower, my 
right foot resting on a ledge about two foot from the ground, I, 
with my left hand&mdash;being a left-handed person, do you 
see&mdash;flung or chucked up a stone, which lighting on the top 
of the steeple, which was at least a hundred and fifty feet high,
did there remain.&nbsp; After repeating this feat two or three 
times, I &lsquo;hulled&rsquo; up a stone, which went clean over 
the tower, and then one&mdash;my right foot still on the 
ledge&mdash;which, rising at least five yards above the steeple, 
did fall down just at my feet.&nbsp; Without knowing it, I was 
showing off my gift to others besides myself, doing what, 
perhaps, not five men in England could do.&nbsp; Two men, who 
were passing by, stopped and looked at my proceedings, and when I
had done flinging came into the churchyard, and, after paying me 
a compliment on what they had seen me do, proposed that I should 
join company with them; I asked them who they were, and they told
me.&nbsp; The one was Hopping Ned and the other Biting 
Giles.&nbsp; Both had their gifts, by which they got their 
livelihood; Ned could hop a hundred yards with any man in 
England, and Giles could lift up with his teeth any dresser or 
kitchen table in the country, and standing erect hold it dangling
in his jaws.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a big oak table and 
dresser, in certain districts of England, which bear the marks of
Giles&rsquo;s teeth; and I make no doubt that, a hundred or two 
years hence, there&rsquo;ll be strange stories <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>about those
marks, and that people will point them out as a proof that there 
were giants in bygone time, and that many a dentist will moralise
on the decays which human teeth have undergone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted me to go about with them, and exhibit my 
gift occasionally, as they did theirs, promising that the money 
that was got by the exhibitions should be honestly divided.&nbsp;
I consented, and we set off together, and that evening coming to 
a village, and putting up at the ale-house, all the grand folks 
of the village being there smoking their pipes, we contrived to 
introduce the subject of hopping&mdash;the upshot being that Ned 
hopped against the schoolmaster for a pound, and beat him hollow;
shortly after, Giles, for a wager, took up the kitchen table in 
his jaws, though he had to pay a shilling to the landlady for the
marks he left, whose grandchildren will perhaps get money by 
exhibiting them.&nbsp; As for myself, I did nothing that day, but
the next, on which my companions did nothing, I showed off at 
hulling stones against a cripple, the crack man for 
stone-throwing of a small town a few miles farther on.&nbsp; Bets
were made to the tune of some pounds; I contrived to beat the 
cripple, and just contrived; for to do him justice I must 
acknowledge he was a first-rate hand at stones, though he had a 
game hip, and went sideways; his head, when he walked&mdash;if 
his movements could be called walking&mdash;not being above three
feet above the ground.&nbsp; So we travelled, I and my 
companions, showing off our gifts, Giles and I occasionally for a
gathering, but Ned never hopping unless against somebody for a 
wager.&nbsp; We lived honestly and comfortably, making no little 
money by our natural endowments, and were known over a great part
of England as &lsquo;Hopping Ned,&rsquo; &lsquo;Biting 
Giles,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hull over the head Jack,&rsquo; which 
was my name, it being the blackguard fashion of the English, do 
you see, to . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may call it a 
blackguard fashion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I dare say it is, 
or it would scarcely be English; but it is an immensely ancient 
one, and is handed down to us from our northern ancestry, 
especially the Danes, who were in the habit of giving people 
surnames, or rather nicknames, from some quality of body or mind,
but generally from some disadvantageous peculiarity of feature; 
for there is no denying that the English, Norse, or whatever we 
may please to call them, are an envious, depreciatory set of 
people, who not only give their poor comrades contemptuous 
surnames, but their great people also.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t 
call you <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the matchless Hurler, because by 
doing so they would have paid you a compliment, but Hull over the
head Jack, as much as to say that after all you were a scrub: so,
in ancient time, instead of calling Regner the great conqueror, 
the Nation Tamer, they surnamed him Lodbrog, which signifies 
Rough or Hairy Breeks&mdash;lod or loddin signifying rough or 
hairy; and instead of complimenting Halgerdr, the wife of Gunnar 
of Hlitharend, the great champion of Iceland, upon her majestic 
presence, by calling her Halgerdr, the stately or tall; what must
they do but term her Ha-brokr, or High-breeks, it being the 
fashion in old times for Northern ladies to wear breeks, or 
breeches, which English ladies of the present day never think of 
doing; and just, as of old, they called Halgerdr Long-breeks, so 
this very day a fellow of Horncastle called, in my hearing, our 
noble-looking Hungarian friend here, Long-stockings.&nbsp; Oh, I 
could give you a hundred instances, both ancient and modern, of 
this unseemly propensity of our illustrious race, though I will 
only trouble you with a few more ancient ones.&nbsp; They not 
only nicknamed Regner, but his sons also, who were all kings, and
distinguished men: one, whose name was Biorn, they nicknamed 
Ironsides; another, Sigurd, Snake in the Eye; another, White 
Sark, or White Shirt&mdash;I wonder they did not call him Dirty 
Shirt; and Ivarr, another, who was king of Northumberland, they 
called Beinlausi, or the Legless, because he was spindle-shanked,
had no sap in his bones, and consequently no children.&nbsp; He 
was a great king, it is true, and very wise, nevertheless his 
blackguard countrymen, always averse, as their descendants are, 
to give credit to anybody for any valuable quality or possession,
must needs lay hold, do you see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before I could say any more, the jockey, having laid down 
his pipe, rose, and having taken off his coat, advanced towards 
me.</p>

DEALING&mdash;HORSE-WITCHERY&mdash;DARIUS AND HIS GROOM&mdash;THE
JOCKEY&rsquo;S TRICKS&mdash;THE TWO CHARACTERS&mdash;THE 
JOCKEY&rsquo;S SONG.</p>
<p>The jockey, having taken off his coat and advanced towards me,
as I have stated in the preceding chapter, exclaimed, in an <!-- 
page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
254</span>angry tone, &ldquo;This is the third time you have 
interrupted me in my tale, Mr. Rye; I passed over the two first 
times with a simple warning, but you will now please to get up 
and give me the satisfaction of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I have 
given you offence, but you were talking of our English habit of 
bestowing nicknames, and I could not refrain from giving a few 
examples tending to prove what a very ancient habit it 
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you interrupted me,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;and put me out of my tale, which you had no right to do; 
and as for your examples, how do you know that I wasn&rsquo;t 
going to give some as old or older than yourn?&nbsp; Now stand 
up, and I&rsquo;ll make an example of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I confess it was wrong in 
me to interrupt you, and I ask your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
&ldquo;asking pardon won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, getting up, &ldquo;if asking pardon 
does not satisfy you, you are a different man from what I 
considered you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the Hungarian, also getting up, interposed his tall 
form and pipe between us, saying in English, scarcely 
intelligible, &ldquo;Let there be no dispute!&nbsp; As for 
myself, I am very much obliged to the young man of Horncastle for
his interruption, though he has told me that one of his dirty 
townsmen called me &lsquo;Long-stockings.&rsquo;&nbsp; By Isten! 
there is more learning in what he has just said, than in all the 
verdammt English histories of Thor and Tzernebock I ever 
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing for his learning,&rdquo; said the 
jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I consider myself as good a man as he, for 
all his learning; so stand out of the way, Mr. Sixfoot-eleven, or
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said the 
Hungarian.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder you are not ashamed of 
yourself.&nbsp; You ask young man to drink champagne with you, 
you make him dronk, he interrupt you with very good sense; he ask
your pardon, yet you not . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;I am 
satisfied.&nbsp; I am rather a short-tempered person, but I bear 
no malice.&nbsp; He is, as you say, drinking my wine, and has 
perhaps taken a drop too much, not being used to such high 
liquor; but one doesn&rsquo;t like to be put out of one&rsquo;s 
tale, more especially when one was about to moralise, do you see,
oneself, and to show off what <!-- page 255--><a 
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>little 
learning one has.&nbsp; However, I bears no malice.&nbsp; Here is
a hand to each of you; we&rsquo;ll take another glass each, and 
think no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jockey having shaken both of our hands, and filled our 
glasses and his own with what champagne remained in the bottle, 
put on his coat, sat down, and resumed his pipe and story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I?&nbsp; Oh, roaming about the country with 
Hopping Ned and Biting Giles.&nbsp; Those were happy days, and a 
merry and prosperous life we led.&nbsp; However, nothing 
continues under the sun in the same state in which it begins, and
our firm was soon destined to undergo a change.&nbsp; We came to 
a village where there was a very high church steeple, and in a 
little time my comrades induced a crowd of people to go and see 
me display my gift by flinging stones above the heads of Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John, who stood at the four corners on the top, 
carved in stone.&nbsp; The parson, seeing the crowd, came 
waddling out of his rectory to see what was going on.&nbsp; After
I had flung up the stones, letting them fall just where I 
liked&mdash;and one, I remember, fell on the head of Mark, where 
I dare say it remains to the present day&mdash;the parson, who 
was one of the description of people called philosophers, held up
his hand, and asked me to let the next stone I flung up fall into
it.&nbsp; He wished, do you see, to know with what weight the 
stone would fall down, and talked something about 
gravitation&mdash;a word which I could never understand to the 
present day, save that it turned out a grave matter to me.&nbsp; 
I, like a silly fellow myself, must needs consent, and, flinging 
the stone up to a vast height, contrived so that it fell into the
parson&rsquo;s hand, which it cut dreadfully.&nbsp; The parson 
flew into a great rage, more particularly as everybody laughed at
him, and, being a magistrate, ordered his clerk, who was likewise
constable, to conduct me to prison as a rogue and a vagabond, 
telling my comrades that if they did not take themselves off, he 
would serve them in the same manner.&nbsp; So Ned hopped off, and
Giles ran after him, without making any gathering, and I was led 
to Bridewell, my mittimus following at the end of a week, the 
parson&rsquo;s hand not permitting him to write before that 
time.&nbsp; In the Bridewell I remained a month, when, being 
dismissed, I went in quest of my companions, whom, after some 
time, I found up, but they refused to keep my company any longer;
telling me that I was a dangerous <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>character, 
likely to bring them more trouble than profit; they had, 
moreover, filled up my place.&nbsp; Going into a cottage to ask 
for a drink of water, they saw a country fellow making faces to 
amuse his children; the faces were so wonderful that Hopping Ned 
and Biting Giles at once proposed taking him into partnership, 
and the man&mdash;who was a fellow not very fond of 
work&mdash;after a little entreaty, went away with them.&nbsp; I 
saw him exhibit his gift, and couldn&rsquo;t blame the others for
preferring him to me; he was a proper ugly fellow at all times, 
but when he made faces his countenance was like nothing 
human.&nbsp; He was called Ugly Moses.&nbsp; I was so amazed at 
his faces, that though poor myself I gave him sixpence, which I 
have never grudged to this day, for I never saw anything like 
them.&nbsp; The firm throve wonderfully after he had been 
admitted into it.&nbsp; He died some little time ago, keeper of a
public-house, which he had been enabled to take from the profits 
of his faces.&nbsp; A son of his, one of the children he was 
making faces to when my comrades entered his door, is at present 
a barrister, and a very rising one.&nbsp; He has his 
gift&mdash;he has not, it is true, the gift of the gab, but he 
has something better, he was born with a grin on his face, a 
quiet grin; he would not have done to grin through a collar like 
his father, and would never have been taken up by Hopping Ned and
Biting Giles, but that grin of his caused him to be noticed by a 
much greater person than either; an attorney observing it took a 
liking to the lad, and prophesied that he would some day be heard
of in the world; and in order to give him the first lift, took 
him into his office, at first to light fires and do such kind of 
work, and after a little time taught him to write, then promoted 
him to a desk, articled him afterwards, and being unmarried and 
without children, left him what he had when he died.&nbsp; The 
young fellow, after practising at the law some time, went to the 
bar, where, in a few years, helped on by his grin, for he had 
nothing else to recommend him, he became, as I said before, a 
rising barrister.&nbsp; He comes our circuit, and I occasionally 
employ him, when I am obliged to go to law about such a thing as 
an unsound horse.&nbsp; He generally brings me through&mdash;or 
rather that grin of his does&mdash;and yet I don&rsquo;t like the
fellow, confound him, but I&rsquo;m an oddity&mdash;no, the one I
like, and whom I generally employ, is a fellow quite different, a
bluff sturdy dog, with no grin on his face, but with a look which
seems to say I am an honest man, <!-- page 257--><a 
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>and what 
cares I for any one.&nbsp; And an honest man he is, and something
more.&nbsp; I have known coves with a better gift of the gab, 
though not many, but he always speaks to the purpose, and 
understands law thoroughly; and that&rsquo;s not all.&nbsp; When 
at college, for he has been at college, he carried off everything
before him as a Latiner, and was first-rate at a game they call 
matthew mattocks.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is, 
but I have heard that he who is first-rate at matthew mattocks is
thought more of than if he were first-rate Latiner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chap that I&rsquo;m talking about, not only 
came out first-rate Latiner, but first-rate at matthew mattocks 
too; doing, in fact&mdash;as I am told by those who knows, for I 
was never at college myself&mdash;what no one had ever done 
before.&nbsp; Well, he makes his appearance at our circuit, does 
very well, of course, but he has a somewhat high front, as 
becomes an honest man, and one who has beat every one at Latin 
and matthew mattocks; and who can speak first-rate law and 
sense;&mdash;but see now, the cove with the grin, who has like 
myself never been at college, knows nothing of Latin, or matthew 
mattocks, and has no particular gift of the gab, has two briefs 
for his one, and I suppose very properly, for that grin of his 
curries favour with the juries; and mark me, that grin of his 
will enable him to beat the other in the long run.&nbsp; We all 
know what all barrister coves looks forward to&mdash;a seat on 
the hop sack.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll bet a bull to fivepence, 
that the grinner gets upon it, and the snarler doesn&rsquo;t; at 
any rate, that he gets there first.&nbsp; I calls my 
cove&mdash;for he is my cove&mdash;a snarler; because your 
first-rates at matthew mattocks are called snarlers, and for no 
other reason; for the chap, though with a high front, is a good 
chap, and once drank a glass of ale with me, after buying an 
animal out of my stable.&nbsp; I have often thought it a pity 
that he wasn&rsquo;t born with a grin on his face, like the son 
of Ugly <i>Moses</i>.&nbsp; It is true he would scarcely then 
have been an out and outer at Latin and matthew mattocks, but 
what need of either to a chap born with a grin?&nbsp; Talk of 
being born with a silver spoon in one&rsquo;s mouth! give me a 
cove born with a grin on his face&mdash;a much better 
endowment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will now shorten my history as much as I can, for we 
have talked as much as folks do during a whole night in the 
Commons&rsquo; House, though, of course, not with so much 
learning, or so much to the purpose, because&mdash;why?&nbsp; 
They are in the House of Commons, and we in a public room of an 
inn at <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Horncastle.&nbsp; The goodness of 
the ale, do ye see, never depending on what it is made of, oh, 
no! but on the fashion and appearance of the jug in which it is 
served up.&nbsp; After being turned out of the firm, I got my 
living in two or three honest ways, which I shall not trouble you
with describing.&nbsp; I did not like any of them, however, as 
they did not exactly suit my humour; at last I found one which 
did.&nbsp; One Saturday forenoon, I chanced to be in the 
cattle-market of a place about eighty miles from here; there I 
won the favour of an old gentleman who sold dickeys.&nbsp; He had
a very shabby squad of animals, without soul or spirit; nobody 
would buy them, till I leaped upon their hinder ends, and by 
merely wriggling in a particular manner, made them caper and 
bound so to people&rsquo;s liking, that in a few hours every one 
of them was sold at very sufficient prices.&nbsp; The old 
gentleman was so pleased with my skill, that he took me home with
him, and in a very little time into partnership.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a good thing to have a gift, but yet better to have two.&nbsp; I 
might have got a very decent livelihood by throwing stones, but I
much question whether I should ever have attained to the position
in society which I now occupy, but for my knowledge of 
animals.&nbsp; I lived very comfortably with the old gentleman 
till he died, which he did about a fortnight after he had laid 
his old lady in the ground.&nbsp; Having no children, he left me 
what should remain after he had been buried decently, and the 
remainder was six dickeys and thirty shillings in silver.&nbsp; I
remained in the dickey trade ten years, during which time I saved
a hundred pounds.&nbsp; I then embarked in the horse line.&nbsp; 
One day, being in the . . . market on a Saturday, I saw Mary 
Fulcher with a halter round her neck, led about by a man, who 
offered to sell her for eighteen-pence.&nbsp; I took out the 
money forthwith and bought her; the man was her husband, a 
basket-maker, with whom she had lived several years without 
having any children; he was a drunken, quarrelsome fellow, and 
having had a dispute with her the day before, he determined to 
get rid of her by putting a halter round her neck and leading her
to the cattle-market, as if she were a mare, which he had, it 
seems, a right to do; all women being considered mares by old 
English law, and, indeed, still called mares in certain counties,
where genuine old English is still preserved.&nbsp; That same 
afternoon, the man who had been her husband, having got drunk in 
a public-house with the money which he had received for her, 
quarrelled <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>with another man, and receiving a 
blow under the ear, fell upon the floor, and died of artiflex; 
and in less than three weeks I was married to Mary Fulcher, by 
virtue of regular bans.&nbsp; I am told she was legally my 
property by virtue of my having bought her with a halter round 
her neck; but, to tell you the truth, I think everybody should 
live by his trade, and I didn&rsquo;t wish to act shabbily 
towards our parson, who is a good fellow, and has certainly a 
right to his fees.&nbsp; A better wife than Mary Fulcher&mdash;I 
mean Mary Dale&mdash;no one ever had; she has borne me several 
children, and has at all times shown a willingness to oblige me, 
and to be my faithful wife.&nbsp; Amongst other things, I begged 
her to have done with her family, and I believe she has never 
spoken to them since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thriven very well in business, and my name is up
as being a person who can be depended on, when folks treats me 
handsomely.&nbsp; I always make a point when a gentleman comes to
me and says, &lsquo;Mr. Dale,&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;John&rsquo;&mdash;for I have no objection to be called 
John by a gentleman&mdash;&lsquo;I wants a good horse, and I am 
ready to pay a good price&rsquo;&mdash;I always makes a point, I 
say, to furnish him with an animal worth the money; but when I 
sees a fellow, whether he calls himself gentleman or not, wishing
to circumvent me, what does I do?&nbsp; I doesn&rsquo;t quarrel 
with him; not I; but, letting him imagine he is taking me in, I 
contrives to sell him a screw for thirty pounds, not worth forty 
shillings.&nbsp; All honest respectable people have at present 
great confidence in me, and frequently commissions me to buy them
horses at great fairs like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This short young gentleman was recommended to me by a 
great landed proprietor, to whom he bore letters of 
recommendation from some great prince in his own country, who had
a long time ago been entertained at the house of the landed 
proprietor, and the consequence is, that I brings young six foot 
six to Horncastle, and purchases for him the horse of the Romany 
Rye.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t do these kind things for nothing, it is 
true; that can&rsquo;t be expected; for every one must live by 
his trade; but, as I said before, when I am treated handsomely, I
treat folks so.&nbsp; Honesty, I have discovered, as perhaps some
other people have, is by far the best policy; though, as I also 
said before, when I&rsquo;m along with thieves, I can beat them 
at their own game.&nbsp; If I am obliged to do it, I can pass off
the veriest screw as a flying drummedary, for even when I was a 
child I had found out by various means what may be done <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
260</span>with animals.&nbsp; I wish now to ask a civil question,
Mr. Romany Rye.&nbsp; Certain folks have told me that you are a 
horse witch; are you one, or are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, like yourself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;know, to a 
certain extent, what may be done with animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how would you, Mr. Romany Rye, pass off the 
veriest screw in the world for a flying drummedary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By putting a small live eel down his throat; as long as
the eel remained in his stomach, the horse would appear brisk and
lively in a surprising degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how would you contrive to make a regular kicker and
biter appear so tame and gentle, that any respectable fat old 
gentleman of sixty, who wanted an easy goer, would be glad to 
purchase him for fifty pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By pouring down his throat four pints of generous old 
ale, which would make him so happy and comfortable, that he would
not have the heart to kick or bite anybody, for a season at 
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you learn all this?&rdquo; said the 
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read about the eel in an old English book, and 
about the making drunk in a Spanish novel, and, singularly 
enough, I was told the same things by a wild blacksmith in 
Ireland.&nbsp; Now tell me, do you bewitch horses in this 
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;mercy upon us!&nbsp; 
I wouldn&rsquo;t do such things for a hatful of money.&nbsp; No, 
no, preserve me from live eels and hocussing!&nbsp; And now let 
me ask you how you would spirit a horse out of a 
field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would I spirit a horse out of a field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! supposing you were down in the world, and had 
determined on taking up the horse-stealing line of 
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should . . .&nbsp; But I tell you what, friend, 
I see you are trying to pump me, and I tell you plainly that I 
will hear something from you with respect to your art, before I 
tell you anything more.&nbsp; Now, how would you whisper a horse 
out of a field, provided you were down in the world, and so 
forth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah, I see you are up to game, Mr. Romany: however, 
I am a gentleman in mind, if not by birth, and I scorn to do the 
unhandsome thing to anybody who has dealt fairly towards 
me.&nbsp; Now you told me something I didn&rsquo;t know, and 
I&rsquo;ll tell you something which perhaps you do know.&nbsp; I 
whispers a horse out of a field in this way: I have a mare in my 
stable; well, in the early season of the year I goes into my 
stable . . . <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Well, I puts the sponge into a small
bottle which I keeps corked.&nbsp; I takes my bottle in my hand, 
and goes into a field, suppose by night, where there is a very 
fine stag horse.&nbsp; I manage with great difficulty to get 
within ten yards of the horse, who stands staring at me just 
ready to run away.&nbsp; I then uncorks my bottle, presses, my 
fore-finger to the sponge, and holds it out to the horse; the 
horse gives a sniff, then a start, and comes nearer.&nbsp; I 
corks up my bottle and puts it into my pocket.&nbsp; My business 
is done, for the next two hours the horse would follow me 
anywhere&mdash;the difficulty, indeed, would be to get rid of 
him.&nbsp; Now is that your way of doing business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My way of doing business?&nbsp; Mercy upon us!&nbsp; I 
wouldn&rsquo;t steal a horse in that way, or, indeed, in any way,
for all the money in the world: however, let me tell you, for 
your comfort, that a trick somewhat similar is described in the 
history of Herodotus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the history of Herod&rsquo;s ass!&rdquo; said the 
jockey; &ldquo;well, if I did write a book it should be about 
something more genteel than a dickey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say Herod&rsquo;s ass,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;but Herodotus, a very genteel writer, I assure you, who 
wrote a history about very genteel people, in a language no less 
genteel than Greek, more than two thousand years ago.&nbsp; There
was a dispute as to who should be king amongst certain imperious 
chieftains.&nbsp; At last they agreed to obey him whose horse 
should neigh first on a certain day, in front of the royal 
palace, before the rising of the sun; for you must know that they
did not worship the person who made the sun as we do, but the sun
itself.&nbsp; So one of these chieftains, talking over the matter
to his groom, and saying he wondered who would be king, the 
fellow said, &lsquo;Why you, master, or I don&rsquo;t know much 
about horses.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the day before the day of trial, 
what does the groom do, but take his master&rsquo;s horse before 
the palace and introduce him to a mare in the stable, and then 
lead him forth again.&nbsp; Well, early the next day all the 
chieftains on their horses appeared in front of the palace before
the dawn of day.&nbsp; Not a horse neighed but one, and that was 
the horse of him who had consulted with his groom, who, thinking 
of the animal within the stable, gave such a neigh that all the 
buildings rang.&nbsp; His rider was forthwith elected king, and a
brave king he was.&nbsp; So this shows what seemingly wonderful 
things may be brought about by a little preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>&ldquo;It doth,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;what was
the chap&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&mdash;his name&mdash;Darius 
Hystaspes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the groom&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he made a good king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only think! well, if he made a good king, what a 
wonderful king the groom would have made, through whose knowledge
of &rsquo;orses he was put on the throne.&nbsp; And now another 
question, Mr. Romany Rye: have you particular words which have 
power to soothe or aggravate horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should ask me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whether I have
horses that can be aggravated or soothed by particular 
words.&nbsp; No words have any particular power over horses or 
other animals who have never heard them before&mdash;how should 
they?&nbsp; But certain animals connect ideas of misery or 
enjoyment with particular words which they are acquainted 
with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you an example.&nbsp; I knew a cob in
Ireland that could be driven to a state of kicking madness by a 
particular word, used by a particular person, in a particular 
tone; but that word was connected with a very painful operation 
which had been performed upon him by that individual, who had 
frequently employed it at a certain period whilst the animal had 
been under his treatment.&nbsp; The same cob could be soothed in 
a moment by another word, used by the same individual in a very 
different kind of tone&mdash;the word was deaghblasda, or sweet 
tasted.&nbsp; Some time after the operation, whilst the cob was 
yet under his hands, the fellow&mdash;who was what the Irish call
a fairy smith&mdash;had done all he could to soothe the creature,
and had at last succeeded by giving it gingerbread-buttons, of 
which the cob became passionately fond.&nbsp; Invariably, 
however, before giving it a button, he said, 
&lsquo;Deaghblasda,&rsquo; with which word the cob by degrees 
associated an idea of unmixed enjoyment: so if he could rouse the
cob to madness by the word which recalled the torture to its 
remembrance, he could as easily soothe it by the other word, 
which the cob knew would be instantly followed by the button, 
which the smith never failed to give him after using the word 
deaghblasda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing wonderful to be done,&rdquo; said the 
jockey, &ldquo;without a good deal of preparation, as I know 
myself.&nbsp; Folks stare and wonder at certain things which they
would only laugh at if they knew how they were done; and to prove
what <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>I say is true, I will give you one 
or two examples.&nbsp; Can either of you lend me a 
handkerchief?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said he, as I 
presented him with a silk one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish for a delicate
white handkerchief.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the kind of 
thing,&rdquo; said he, as the Hungarian offered him a fine white 
cambric handkerchief, beautifully worked with gold at the hems; 
&ldquo;now you shall see me set this handkerchief on 
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him do so by any 
means,&rdquo; said the Hungarian, speaking to me in German; 
&ldquo;it is the gift of a lady whom I highly admire, and I would
not have it burnt for the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He has no 
occasion to be under any apprehension,&rdquo; said the jockey, 
after I had interpreted to him what the Hungarian had said; 
&ldquo;I will restore it to him uninjured, or my name is not Jack
Dale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then sticking the handkerchief carelessly into
the left side of his bosom, he took the candle, which by this 
time had burnt very low, and holding his head back, he applied 
the flame to the handkerchief, which instantly seemed to catch 
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; said he to 
the Hungarian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, that you have ruined me,&rdquo; 
said the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;No harm done, I assure you,&rdquo; 
said the jockey, who presently, clapping his hand on his bosom, 
extinguished the fire, and returned the handkerchief to the 
Hungarian, asking him if it was burnt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see no burn
upon it,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;but in the name of 
Gott how could you set it on fire without burning 
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never set it on fire at all,&rdquo; 
said the jockey; &ldquo;I set this on fire,&rdquo; showing us a 
piece of half-burnt calico.&nbsp; &ldquo;I placed this calico 
above it, and lighted not the handkerchief, but the rag.&nbsp; 
Now I will show you something else.&nbsp; I have a magic shilling
in my pocket, which I can make run up along my arm.&nbsp; But, 
first of all, I would gladly know whether either of you can do 
the like.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Hungarian and myself, 
putting our hands into our pockets, took out shillings, and 
endeavoured to make them run up our arms, but utterly failed; 
both shillings, after we had made two or three attempts, falling 
to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;What noncomposses you both 
are,&rdquo; said the jockey; and placing a shilling on the end of
the fingers of his right hand he made strange faces to it, 
drawing back his head, whereupon the shilling instantly began to 
run up his arm, occasionally hopping and jumping as if it were 
bewitched, always endeavouring to make towards the head of the 
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I do that?&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to
me.&nbsp; <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>&ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;unless it is by the motion of your 
arm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The motion of my nonsense,&rdquo; said 
the jockey, and, making a dreadful grimace, the shilling hopped 
upon his knee, and began to run up his thigh and to climb his 
breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is that done?&rdquo; said he 
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;By witchcraft, I suppose,&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said the jockey; 
&ldquo;by the witchcraft of one of Miss Berners&rsquo; hairs; the
end of one of her long hairs is tied to that shilling by means of
a hole in it, and the other end goes round my neck by means of a 
loop; so that, when I draw back my head, the shilling follows 
it.&nbsp; I suppose you wish to know how I got the hair,&rdquo; 
said he, grinning at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell you.&nbsp; I 
once, in the course of my ridings, saw Miss Berners beneath a 
hedge, combing out her long hair, and, being rather a modest kind
of person, what must I do but get off my horse, tie him to a 
gate, go up to her, and endeavour to enter into conversation with
her.&nbsp; After giving her the sele of the day, and 
complimenting her on her hair, I asked her to give me one of the 
threads; whereupon she gave me such a look, and, calling me 
fellow, told me to take myself off.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must have a 
hair first,&rsquo; said I, making a snatch at one.&nbsp; I 
believe I hurt her; but, whether I did or not, up she started, 
and, though her hair was unbound, gave me the only drubbing I 
ever had in my life.&nbsp; Lor! how, with her right hand, she 
fibbed me whilst she held me round the neck with her left arm; I 
was soon glad to beg her pardon on my knees, which she gave me in
a moment when she saw me in that condition, being the most 
placable creature in the world, and not only her pardon, but one 
of the hairs which I longed for, which I put through a shilling, 
with which I have on evenings after fairs, like this, frequently 
worked what seemed to those who looked on downright witchcraft, 
but which is nothing more than pleasant deception.&nbsp; And now,
Mr. Romany Rye, to testify my regard for you, I give you the 
shilling and the hair.&nbsp; I think you have a kind of respect 
for Miss Berners; but whether you have or not, keep them as long 
as you can, and whenever you look at them think of the finest 
woman in England, and of John Dale, the jockey of 
Horncastle.&nbsp; I believe I have told you my history,&rdquo; 
said he&mdash;&ldquo;no, not quite; there is one circumstance I 
had passed over.&nbsp; I told you that I have thriven very well 
in business, and so I have upon the whole: at any rate, I find 
myself comfortably off now.&nbsp; I have horses, money, and owe 
nobody a groat; at any rate, nothing but <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>what I 
could pay to-morrow.&nbsp; Yet I have had my dreary day, ay, 
after I had obtained what I call a station in the world.&nbsp; 
All of a sudden, about five years ago, everything seemed to go 
wrong with me&mdash;horses became sick or died, people who owed 
me money broke or ran away, my house caught fire, in fact, 
everything went against me; and not from any mismanagement of my 
own.&nbsp; I looked round for help, but&mdash;what do you think? 
nobody would help me.&nbsp; Somehow or other it had got abroad 
that I was in difficulties, and everybody seemed disposed to 
avoid me, as if I had got the plague.&nbsp; Those who were always
offering me help when I wanted none, now, when they thought me in
trouble, talked of arresting me.&nbsp; Yes, two particular 
friends of mine, who had always been offering me their purses 
when my own was stuffed full, now talked of arresting me, though 
I only owed the scoundrels a hundred pounds each; and they would 
have done so, provided I had not paid them what I owed them; and 
how did I do that?&nbsp; Why, I was able to do it because I found
a friend&mdash;and who was that friend?&nbsp; Why, a man who has 
since been hung, of whom everybody has heard, and of whom 
everybody for the next hundred years will occasionally talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, whilst in trouble, I was visited by a person I
had occasionally met at sporting-dinners.&nbsp; He came to look 
after a Suffolk Punch, the best horse, by-the-bye, that anybody 
can purchase to drive, it being the only animal of the horse kind
in England that will pull twice at a dead weight.&nbsp; I told 
him that I had none at that time that I could recommend; in fact,
that every horse in my stable was sick.&nbsp; He then invited me 
to dine with him at an inn close by, and I was glad to go with 
him, in the hope of getting rid of unpleasant thoughts.&nbsp; 
After dinner, during which he talked nothing but slang, observing
I looked very melancholy, he asked me what was the matter with 
me, and I, my heart being opened by the wine he had made me 
drink, told him my circumstances without reserve.&nbsp; With an 
oath or two for not having treated him at first like a friend, he
said he would soon set me all right; and pulling out two hundred 
pounds, told me to pay him when I could.&nbsp; I felt as I never 
felt before; however, I took his notes, paid my sneaks, and in 
less than three months was right again, and had returned him his 
money.&nbsp; On paying it to him, I said that I had now a Punch 
which would just suit him, saying that I would give it to 
him&mdash;a free gift&mdash;for nothing.&nbsp; He swore at me; 
telling me to <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>keep my Punch, for that he was 
suited already.&nbsp; I begged him to tell me how I could requite
him for his kindness, whereupon, with the most dreadful oath I 
ever heard, he bade me come and see him hanged when his time was 
come.&nbsp; I wrung his hand, and told him I would, and I kept my
word.&nbsp; The night before the day he was hanged at H . . ., I 
harnessed a Suffolk Punch to my light gig, the same Punch which I
had offered to him, which I have ever since kept, and which 
brought me and this short young man to Horncastle, and in eleven 
hours I drove that Punch one hundred and ten miles.&nbsp; I 
arrived at H . . . just in the nick of time.&nbsp; There was the 
ugly jail&mdash;the scaffold&mdash;and there upon it stood the 
only friend I ever had in the world.&nbsp; Driving my Punch, 
which was all in a foam, into the midst of the crowd, which made 
way for me as if it knew what I came for, I stood up in my gig, 
took off my hat, and shouted, &lsquo;God Almighty bless you, 
Jack!&rsquo;&nbsp; The dying man turned his pale grim face 
towards me&mdash;for his face was always somewhat grim, do you 
see&mdash;nodded and said, or I thought I heard him say, 
&lsquo;All right, old chap.&rsquo;&nbsp; The next moment . . . my
eyes water.&nbsp; He had a high heart, got into a scrape whilst 
in the marines, lost his half-pay, took to the turf, ring, 
gambling, and at last cut the throat of a villain who had robbed 
him of nearly all he had.&nbsp; But he had good qualities, and I 
know for certain that he never did half the bad things laid to 
his charge; for example, he never bribed Tom Oliver to fight 
cross, as it was said he did, on the day of the awful 
thunder-storm.&nbsp; Ned Flatnose fairly beat Tom Oliver, for 
though Ned was not what&rsquo;s called a good fighter, he had a 
particular blow, which if he could put in he was sure to 
win.&nbsp; His right shoulder, do you see, was two inches farther
back than it ought to have been, and consequently his right fist 
generally fell short; but if he could swing himself round, and 
put in a blow with that right arm, he could kill or take away the
senses of anybody in the world.&nbsp; It was by putting in that 
blow in his second fight with Spring that he beat noble 
Tom.&nbsp; Spring beat him like a sack in the first battle, but 
in the second Ned Painter&mdash;for that was his real 
name&mdash;contrived to put in his blow, and took the senses out 
of Spring; and in like manner he took the senses out of Tom 
Oliver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and
many of those who are not hanged are much worse than those who 
are.&nbsp; Jack, with many a good quality, is hanged, whilst <!--
page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
267</span>that fellow of a lord, who wanted to get the horse from
you at about two-thirds of his value, without a single good 
quality in the world, is not hanged, and probably will remain 
so.&nbsp; You ask the reason why, perhaps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell 
you: the lack of a certain quality called courage, which Jack 
possessed in abundance, will preserve him; from the love which he
bears his own neck he will do nothing that can bring him to the 
gallows.&nbsp; In my rough way I&rsquo;ll draw their characters 
from their childhood, and then ask whether Jack was not the best 
character of the two.&nbsp; Jack was a rough, audacious boy, fond
of fighting, going a birds&rsquo;-nesting, but I never heard he 
did anything particularly cruel save once, I believe, tying a 
canister to a butcher&rsquo;s dog&rsquo;s tail; whilst this 
fellow of a lord was by nature a savage beast, and when a boy 
would in winter pluck poor fowls naked, and set them running on 
the ice and in the snow, and was particularly fond of burning 
cats alive in the fire.&nbsp; Jack, when a lad, gets a commission
on board a ship as an officer of horse marines, and in two or 
three engagements behaves quite up to the mark&mdash;at least of 
a marine; the marines having no particular character for courage,
you know&mdash;never having run to the guns and fired them like 
madmen after the blue jackets had had more than enough.&nbsp; Oh,
dear me, no!&nbsp; My lord gets into the valorous British army, 
where cowardice&mdash;oh, dear me!&mdash;is a thing almost 
entirely unknown; and being on the field of Waterloo the day 
before the battle, falls off his horse, and, pretending to be 
hurt in the back, gets himself put on the sick list&mdash;a 
pretty excuse&mdash;hurting his back&mdash;for not being present 
at such a fight.&nbsp; Old Benbow, after part of both his legs 
had been shot away in a sea-fight, made the carpenter make him a 
cradle to hold his bloody stumps, and continued on deck cheering 
his men till he died.&nbsp; Jack returns home, and gets into 
trouble, and having nothing to subsist by but his wits, gets his 
living by the ring, and the turf, and gambling, doing many an odd
kind of thing, I dare say, but not half those laid to his 
charge.&nbsp; My lord does much the same without the excuse for 
doing so which Jack had, for he had plenty of means, is a leg, 
and a black, only in a more polished way, and with more cunning, 
and I may say success, having done many a rascally thing never 
laid to his charge.&nbsp; Jack at last cuts the throat of a 
villain who had cheated him of all he had in the world, and who, 
I am told, was in many points the counterpart of this screw and 
white feather, is taken up, tried, and executed; and <!-- page 
268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
268</span>certainly taking away a man&rsquo;s life is a dreadful 
thing; but is there nothing as bad?&nbsp; Whitefeather will cut 
no person&rsquo;s throat&mdash;I will not say who has cheated 
him, for, being a cheat himself, he will take good care that 
nobody cheats him, but he&rsquo;ll do something quite as bad; out
of envy to a person who never injured him, and whom he hates for 
being more clever and respected than himself, he will do all he 
possibly can, by backbiting and every unfair means, to do that 
person a mortal injury.&nbsp; But Jack is hanged, and my lord is 
not.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp; My wife, Mary Fulcher&mdash;I beg
her pardon, Mary Dale&mdash;who is a Methodist, and has heard the
mighty preacher, Peter Williams, says some people are preserved 
from hanging by the grace of God.&nbsp; With her I differs, and 
says it is from want of courage.&nbsp; This Whitefeather, with 
one particle of Jack&rsquo;s courage, and with one tithe of his 
good qualities, would have been hanged long ago, for he has ten 
times Jack&rsquo;s malignity.&nbsp; Jack was hanged because, 
along with his bad qualities, he had courage and generosity; this
fellow is not, because with all Jack&rsquo;s bad qualities, and 
many more, amongst which is cunning, he has neither courage nor 
generosity.&nbsp; Think of a fellow like that putting down two 
hundred pounds to relieve a distressed fellow-creature; why, he 
would rob, but for the law and the fear it fills him with, a 
workhouse child of its breakfast, as the saying is&mdash;and has 
been heard to say that he would not trust his own father for 
sixpence, and he can&rsquo;t imagine why such a thing as credit 
should be ever given.&nbsp; I never heard a person give him a 
good word&mdash;stay, stay, yes!&nbsp; I once heard an old 
parson, to whom I sold a Punch, say that he had the art of 
receiving company gracefully, and dismissing them without 
refreshment.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be too hard with him, 
and so let him make the most of that compliment.&nbsp; Well, he 
manages to get on, whilst Jack is hanged; not quite enviably, 
however; he has had his rubs, and pretty hard 
ones&mdash;everybody knows he slunk from Waterloo, and 
occasionally checks him with so doing; whilst he has been 
rejected by a woman&mdash;what a mortification to the low pride 
of which the scoundrel has plenty!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a song 
about both circumstances, which may, perhaps, ring in his ears on
a dying bed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a funny kind of song, set to the 
old tune of the Lord-Lieutenant or Deputy, and with it I will 
conclude my discourse, for I really think it&rsquo;s past 
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jockey then, with a very tolerable voice, 
sung the following song:&mdash;</p>
<h4><!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<p>THE CHURCH.</p>
<p>The next morning I began to think of departing; I had sewed up
the money which I had received for the horse in a portion of my 
clothing, where I entertained no fears for its safety, with the 
exception of a small sum in notes, gold, and silver, which I 
carried in my pocket.&nbsp; Ere departing, however, I determined 
to stroll about and examine the town, and observe more 
particularly the humours of the fair than I had hitherto an 
opportunity of doing.&nbsp; The town, when I examined it, offered
no object worthy of attention but its church&mdash;an edifice of 
some antiquity; under the guidance of an old man, who officiated 
as sexton, I inspected its interior attentively, occasionally 
conversing with my guide, who, however, seemed much more disposed
to talk about horses than the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;No good horses
in the fair this time, measter,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;none but 
one brought hither by a chap whom nobody knows, and bought by a 
foreigneering man, who came here with Jack Dale.&nbsp; The horse 
fetched a good swinging price, which is said, however, to be much
less than its worth; for the horse is a regular clipper; not such
a one, &rsquo;tis said, has been seen in the fair for several 
summers.&nbsp; Lord Whitefeather says that he believes the fellow
who brought him to be a highwayman, and talks of having him taken
up; but Lord Whitefeather is only in a rage because he could not 
get him for himself.&nbsp; The chap would not sell it to un; Lord
Screw wanted to beat him down, and the chap took huff, said he 
wouldn&rsquo;t sell it to him at no price, and accepted the offer
of the foreigneering man, or of Jack, who was his 
&rsquo;terpreter, and who scorned to higgle about such an 
hanimal, because Jack is a gentleman, though bred a dickey-boy, 
whilst &rsquo;tother, though bred a lord, is a screw, and a 
whitefeather.&nbsp; Every one says the cove was right, and I says
so too; I likes spirit, and if the cove were <!-- page 271--><a 
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>here, and 
in your place, measter, I would invite him to drink a pint of 
beer.&nbsp; Good horses are scarce now, measter, ay, and so are 
good men, quite a different set from what there were when I was 
young; that was the time for men and horses.&nbsp; Lord bless 
you, I know all the breeders about here; they are not a bad set, 
and they breed a very fairish set of horses, but they are not 
like what their fathers were, nor are their horses like their 
fathers&rsquo; horses.&nbsp; Now, there is Mr. . . . , the great 
breeder, a very fairish man, with very fairish horses; but, Lord 
bless you, he&rsquo;s nothing to what his father was, nor his 
steeds to his father&rsquo;s; I ought to know, for I was at the 
school here with his father, and afterwards for many a year 
helped him to get up his horses; that was when I was young, 
measter those were the days.&nbsp; You look at that monument, 
measter,&rdquo; said he, as I stopped and looked attentively at a
monument on the southern side of the church, near the altar; 
&ldquo;that was put up for a rector of this church, who lived a 
long time ago, in Oliver&rsquo;s time, and was ill-treated and 
imprisoned by Oliver and his men; you will see all about it on 
the monument.&nbsp; There was a grand battle fought nigh this 
place, between Oliver&rsquo;s men and the Royal party, and the 
Royal party had the worst of it, as I&rsquo;m told they generally
had; and Oliver&rsquo;s men came into the town, and did a great 
deal of damage, and ill-treated people.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t 
remember anything about the matter myself, for it happened just 
one hundred years before I was born, but my father was acquainted
with an old countryman, who lived not many miles from here, who 
said he remembered perfectly well the day of the battle; that he 
was a boy at the time, and was working in a field near the place 
where the battle was fought: and he heard shouting, and noise of 
firearms, and also the sound of several balls, which fell in the 
field near him.&nbsp; Come this way, measter, and I will show you
some remains of that day&rsquo;s field.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leaving the 
monument, on which was inscribed an account of the life and 
sufferings of the Royalist Rector of Horncastle, I followed the 
sexton to the western end of the church, where, hanging against 
the wall, were a number of scythes stuck in the ends of 
poles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are the weapons, measter,&rdquo; said 
the sexton, &ldquo;which the great people put into the hands of a
number of the country folks, in order that they might use them 
against Oliver&rsquo;s men; ugly weapons enough; however, 
Oliver&rsquo;s men won, and Sir Jacob Ashley and his <!-- page 
272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
272</span>party were beat.&nbsp; And a rare time Oliver and his 
men had of it, till Oliver died, when the other party got the 
better, not by fighting, &rsquo;tis said, but through a General 
Monk, who turned sides.&nbsp; Ah, the old fellow that my father 
knew said he well remembered the time when General Monk went over
and proclaimed Charles the Second.&nbsp; Bonfires were lighted 
everywhere, oxen roasted, and beer drunk by pailfuls; the country
folks were drunk with joy, and something else; sung scurvy songs 
about Oliver to the tune of Barney Banks, and pelted his men, 
wherever they found them, with stones and dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The more ungrateful scoundrels they,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oliver and his men fought the battle of English 
independence against a wretched king and corrupt lords.&nbsp; Had
I been living at the time, I should have been proud to be a 
trooper of Oliver.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You would, measter, would 
you?&nbsp; Well, I never quarrels with the opinions of people who
come to look at the church, and certainly independence is a fine 
thing.&nbsp; I like to see a chap of an independent spirit, and 
if I were now to see the cove who refused to sell his horse to my
Lord Screw and Whitefeather, and let Jack Dale have him, I would 
offer to treat him to a pint of beer&mdash;e&rsquo;es I would, 
verily.&nbsp; Well, measter, you have now seen the church, and 
all there&rsquo;s in it worth seeing&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll just 
lock up, and go and finish digging the grave I was about when you
came, after which I must go into the fair to see how matters are 
going on.&nbsp; Thank ye, measter,&rdquo; said he, as I put 
something into his hand; &ldquo;thank ye kindly; &rsquo;tis not 
every one gives me a shilling nowadays who comes to see the 
church, but times are very different from what they were when I 
was young; I was not sexton then, but something better; helped 
Mr. . . . with his horses, and got many a broad crown.&nbsp; 
Those were the days, measter, both for men and horses&mdash;and I
say, measter, if men and horses were so much better when I was 
young than they are now, what, I wonder, must they have been in 
the time of Oliver and his men?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<p>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</p>
<p>Leaving the church, I strolled through the fair, looking at 
the horses, listening to the chaffering of the buyers and 
sellers, and occasionally putting in a word of my own, which was 
not always received with much deference; suddenly, however, on a 
whisper arising that I was the young cove who had brought the 
wonderful horse to the fair which Jack Dale had bought for the 
foreigneering man, I found myself an object of the greatest 
attention; those who had before replied with stuff! and nonsense!
to what I said, now listened with the greatest eagerness to any 
nonsense which I chose to utter, and I did not fail to utter a 
great deal.&nbsp; Presently, however, becoming disgusted with the
beings about me, I forced my way, not very civilly, through my 
crowd of admirers; and passing through an alley and a back 
street, at last reached an outskirt of the fair, where no person 
appeared to know me.&nbsp; Here I stood, looking vacantly on what
was going on, musing on the strange infatuation of my species, 
who judge of a person&rsquo;s words, not from their intrinsic 
merit, but from the opinion&mdash;generally an erroneous 
one&mdash;which they have formed of the person.&nbsp; From this 
reverie I was roused by certain words which sounded near me, 
uttered in a strange tone, and in a strange cadence&mdash;the 
words were, &ldquo;Them that finds, wins; and them that 
can&rsquo;t finds, loses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning my eyes in the 
direction from which the words proceeded, I saw six or seven 
people, apparently all countrymen, gathered round a person 
standing behind a tall white table of very small compass.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the thimble-engro of . . . 
Fair here at Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Advancing nearer, however, 
I perceived that though the present person was a thimble-engro, 
he was a very different one from my old acquaintance of . . 
.&nbsp; Fair.&nbsp; The present one was a fellow about 
half-a-foot taller than the other.&nbsp; He had a long, haggard, 
wild face, and was dressed in a kind of jacket, something like 
that of a soldier, with dirty hempen trousers, and with a 
foreign-looking peaked hat on his head.&nbsp; He spoke with an 
accent evidently Irish, and occasionally changed the usual 
thimble formula into &ldquo;them that finds, wins; and them that 
can&rsquo;t&mdash;och, sure!&mdash;they loses;&rdquo; saying also
frequently &ldquo;your honour,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;my <!-- 
page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
274</span>lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; I observed, on drawing nearer, that 
he handled the pea and thimble with some awkwardness, like that 
which might be expected from a novice in the trade.&nbsp; He 
contrived, however, to win several shillings&mdash;for he did not
seem to play for gold&mdash;from &ldquo;their 
honours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Awkward as he was, he evidently did his 
best, and never flung a chance away by permitting any one to 
win.&nbsp; He had just won three shillings from a farmer, who, 
incensed at his loss, was calling him a confounded cheat, and 
saying that he would play no more, when up came my friend of the 
preceding day, Jack the jockey.&nbsp; This worthy, after looking 
at the thimble man a moment or two, with a peculiarly crafty 
glance, cried out, as he clapped down a shilling on the table, 
&ldquo;I will stand you, old fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Them 
that finds, wins; and them that can&rsquo;t&mdash;och, 
sure!&mdash;they loses,&rdquo; said the thimble man.&nbsp; The 
game commenced, and Jack took up the thimble without finding the 
pea; another shilling was produced, and lost in the same 
manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is slow work,&rdquo; said Jack, banging
down a guinea on the table; &ldquo;can you cover that, old 
fellow?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man of the thimble looked at the gold, 
and then at him who produced it, and scratched his head.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Come, cover that, or I shall be off,&rdquo; said the 
jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, shure, my lord!&mdash;no, I mean your 
honour&mdash;no, shure, your lordship,&rdquo; said the other, 
&ldquo;if I covers it at all, it must be with silver, for divil a
bit of gold have I by me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, produce
the value in silver,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;and do it 
quickly, for I can&rsquo;t be staying here all day.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The thimble man hesitated, looked at Jack with a dubious look, 
then at the gold, and then scratched his head.&nbsp; There was 
now a laugh amongst the surrounders, which evidently nettled the 
fellow, who forthwith thrust his hand into his pocket, and 
pulling out all his silver treasure, just contrived to place the 
value of the guinea on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them that finds, 
wins; and them that can&rsquo;t finds&mdash;<i>loses</i>,&rdquo; 
interrupted Jack, lifting up a thimble, out of which rolled a 
pea.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, Paddy, what do you think of that?&rdquo;
said he, seizing the heap of silver with one hand, whilst he 
pocketed the guinea with the other.&nbsp; The thimble-engro stood
for some time like one transfixed, his eyes glaring wildly, now 
at the table, and now at his successful customer; at last he 
said, &ldquo;Arrah, sure, master!&mdash;no, I manes my 
lord&mdash;you are not going to ruin a poor boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ruin you!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;what! by winning a
guinea&rsquo;s change? a pretty small dodger you&mdash;if you 
have not sufficient capital, why do you engage in <!-- page 
275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>so
deep a trade as thimbling? come, will you stand another 
game?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, sure, master, no! the twenty 
shillings and one which you have cheated me of were all I had in 
the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheated you!&rdquo; said Jack; 
&ldquo;say that again, and I will knock you down.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Arrah! sure, master, you knows that the pea under the 
thimble was not mine; here is mine, master; now give me back my 
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A likely thing,&rdquo; said Jack; 
&ldquo;no, no, I know a trick worth two or three of that; whether
the pea was yours or mine, you will never have your twenty 
shillings and one again; and if I have ruined you, all the 
better; I&rsquo;d gladly ruin all such villains as you, who ruin 
poor men with your dirty tricks, whom you would knock down and 
rob on the road if you had but courage: not that I mean to keep 
your shillings, with the exception of the two you cheated from 
me, which I&rsquo;ll keep.&nbsp; A scramble, boys! a 
scramble!&rdquo; said he, flinging up all the silver into the 
air, with the exception of the two shillings; and a scramble 
there instantly was, between the rustics who had lost their money
and the urchins who came running up; the poor thimble-engro tried
likewise to have his share; but though he flung himself down, in 
order to join more effectually in the scramble, he was unable to 
obtain a single sixpence; and having in his rage given some of 
his fellow-scramblers a cuff or two, he was set upon by the boys 
and country-fellows, and compelled to make an inglorious retreat 
with his table, which had been flung down in the scuffle, and had
one of its legs broken.&nbsp; As he retired, the rabble hooted, 
and Jack, holding up in derision the pea with which he had 
out-man&oelig;uvred him, exclaimed, &ldquo;I always carry this in
my pocket in order to be a match for vagabonds like 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tumult over, Jack gone, and the rabble dispersed, I 
followed the discomfited adventurer at a distance, who, leaving 
the town, went slowly on, carrying his dilapidated piece of 
furniture; till, coming to an old wall by the roadside, he placed
it on the ground, and sat down, seemingly in deep despondency, 
holding his thumb to his mouth.&nbsp; Going nearly up to him, I 
stood still, whereupon he looked up, and perceiving I was looking
steadfastly at him, he said, in an angry tone, &ldquo;Arrah! what
for are you staring at me so?&nbsp; By my shoul, I think you are 
one of the thaives who are after robbing me.&nbsp; I think I saw 
you among them, and if I were only sure of it, I would take the 
liberty of trying to give you a big bating.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You have had enough of trying to give people a 
beating,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you had <!-- page 276--><a 
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>better be 
taking your table to some skilful carpenter to get it 
repaired.&nbsp; He will do it for sixpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Divil a sixpence did you and your thaives leave me,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;and if you do not take yourself off, joy, I will 
be breaking your ugly head with the foot of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Arrah, Murtagh!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;would ye be breaking
the head of your old friend and scholar, to whom you taught the 
blessed tongue of Oilien nan Naomha, in exchange for a pack of 
cards?&rdquo;&nbsp; Murtagh, for he it was, gazed at me for a 
moment with a bewildered look; then, with a gleam of intelligence
in his eye, he said, &ldquo;Shorsha! no, it can&rsquo;t 
be&mdash;yes, by my faith it is!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, springing up,
and seizing me by the hand, he said, &ldquo;Yes, by the powers, 
sure enough it is Shorsha agra!&nbsp; Arrah, Shorsha! where have 
you been this many a day?&nbsp; Sure, you are not one of the 
spalpeens who are after robbing me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not 
I,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I saw all that happened.&nbsp; 
Come, you must not take matters so to heart; cheer up; such 
things will happen in connection with the trade you have taken 
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow befall the trade, and the thief 
who taught it me,&rdquo; said Murtagh; &ldquo;and yet the trade 
is not a bad one, if I only knew more of it, and had some one to 
help and back me.&nbsp; Och! the idea of being cheated and 
bamboozled by that one-eyed thief in the horseman&rsquo;s 
dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones, 
Murtagh,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it is no use grieving for the 
past; sit down, and let us have a little pleasant gossip.&nbsp; 
Arrah, Murtagh! when I saw you sitting under the wall, with your 
thumb to your mouth, it brought to my mind tales which you used 
to tell me all about Finn ma-Coul.&nbsp; You have not forgotten 
Finn-ma-Coul, Murtagh, and how he sucked wisdom out of his 
thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow a bit have I forgot about him, 
Shorsha,&rdquo; said Murtagh, as we sat down together, &ldquo;nor
what you yourself told me about the snake.&nbsp; Arrah, Shorsha! 
what ye told me about the snake bates anything I ever told you 
about Finn.&nbsp; Ochone, Shorsha! perhaps you will be telling me
about the snake once more?&nbsp; I think the tale would do me 
good, and I have need of comfort, God knows, Ochone!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Seeing Murtagh in such a distressed plight, I forthwith told him 
over again the tale of the snake, in precisely the same words as 
I have related it in the first part of this history.&nbsp; After 
which I said, &ldquo;Now, Murtagh, tit for tat; ye will be 
telling me one of the old stories of Finn-ma-Coul.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Och, Shorsha.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t heart enough,&rdquo; 
said Murtagh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you for your tale, but it makes 
me weep; it brings to mind Dungarvon times <!-- page 277--><a 
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>of 
old&mdash;I mean the times we were at school 
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheer up, man,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;and let&rsquo;s have the story, and let it be about 
Ma-Coul and the salmon, and his thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arrah,
Shorsha!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, to oblige you, 
I&rsquo;ll give it you.&nbsp; Well, you know Ma-Coul was an 
exposed child, and came floating over the salt sea in a chest 
which was cast ashore at Veintry Bay.&nbsp; In the corner of that
bay was a castle, where dwelt a giant and his wife, very 
respectable and dacent people, and this giant, taking his morning
walk along the bay, came to the place where the child had been 
cast ashore in his box.&nbsp; Well, the giant looked at the 
child, and being filled with compassion for his exposed state, 
took the child up in his box, and carried him home to his castle,
where he and his wife, being dacent, respectable people, as I 
telled ye before, fostered the child and took care of him, till 
he became old enough to go out to service and gain his 
livelihood, when they bound him out apprentice to another giant, 
who lived in a castle up the country, at some distance from the 
bay.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This giant, whose name was Darmod David Odeen, was not 
a respectable person at all, but a big ould vagabond.&nbsp; He 
was twice the size of the other giant, who, though bigger than 
any man, was not a big giant; for, as there are great and small 
men, so there are great and small giants&mdash;I mean some are 
small when compared with the others.&nbsp; Well, Finn served this
giant a considerable time, doing all kinds of hard and 
unreasonable service for him, and receiving all kinds of hard 
words, and many a hard knock and kick to boot&mdash;sorrow befall
the ould vagabond who could thus ill-treat a helpless 
foundling.&nbsp; It chanced that one day the giant caught a 
salmon, near a salmon-leap upon his estate&mdash;for, though a 
big ould blackguard, he was a person of considerable landed 
property, and high sheriff for the county Cork.&nbsp; Well, the 
giant brings home the salmon by the gills, and delivers it to 
Finn, telling him to roast it for the giant&rsquo;s dinner; 
&lsquo;but take care, ye young blackguard,&rsquo; he added, 
&lsquo;that in roasting it&mdash;and I expect ye to roast it 
well&mdash;you do not let a blister come upon its nice satin 
skin, for if ye do, I will cut the head off your 
shoulders.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; thinks Finn, 
&lsquo;this is a hard task; however, as I have done many hard 
tasks for him, I will try and do this too, though I was never set
to do anything yet half so difficult.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he prepared
his fire, and put his gridiron upon it, and lays the salmon 
fairly and softly upon the gridiron, and then he roasts it, 
turning it from one side to <!-- page 278--><a 
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>the other 
just in the nick of time, before the soft satin skin could be 
blistered.&nbsp; However, on turning it over the eleventh 
time&mdash;and twelve would have settled the business&mdash;he 
found he had delayed a little bit of time too long in turning it 
over, and there was a small, tiny blister on the soft outer 
skin.&nbsp; Well, Finn was in a mighty panic, remembering the 
threats of the ould giant; however, he did not lose heart, but 
clapped his thumb upon the blister in order to smooth it 
down.&nbsp; Now the salmon, Shorsha, was nearly done, and the 
flesh thoroughly hot, so Finn&rsquo;s thumb was scalt, and he, 
clapping it to his mouth, sucked it, in order to draw out the 
pain, and in a moment&mdash;hubbuboo!&mdash;became imbued with 
all the wisdom of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Stop, Murtagh! stop!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; All the witchcraft, Shorsha.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How wonderful!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; Was it not, Shorsha?&nbsp; The salmon, 
do you see, was a fairy salmon.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What a strange coincidence!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; A what, Shorsha?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why, that the very same tale should be 
told of Finn-ma-Coul, which is related of Sigurd Fafnisbane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thief was that, Shorsha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thief!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he took the treasure of 
Fafnir.&nbsp; Sigurd was the hero of the North, Murtagh, even as 
Finn is the great hero of Ireland.&nbsp; He, too, according to 
one account, was an exposed child, and came floating in a casket 
to a wild shore, where he was suckled by a hind, and afterwards 
found and fostered by Mimir, a fairy blacksmith; he, too, sucked 
wisdom from a burn.&nbsp; According to the Edda, he burnt his 
finger whilst feeling of the heart of Fafnir, which he was 
roasting, and putting it into his mouth in order to suck out the 
pain, became imbued with all the wisdom of the world, the 
knowledge of the language of birds, and what not.&nbsp; I have 
heard you tell the tale of Finn a dozen times in the blessed days
of old, but its identity with the tale of Sigurd never occurred 
to me till now.&nbsp; It is true, when I knew you of old I had 
never read the tale of Sigurd, and have since almost dismissed 
matters of Ireland from my mind; but as soon as you told me again
about Finn&rsquo;s burning his finger, the coincidence struck 
me.&nbsp; I say, Murtagh, the Irish owe much to the Danes . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit, Shorsha, do they owe to the thaives, 
except <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>many a bloody bating and plundering,
which they never paid them back.&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! you, 
edicated in ould Ireland, to say that the Irish owes anything 
good to the plundering villains&mdash;the Siol 
Loughlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They owe them half their traditions, Murtagh, and 
amongst others Finn-ma-Coul and the burnt finger; and if ever I 
publish the Loughlin songs, I&rsquo;ll tell the world 
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Shorsha, the world will never believe ye&mdash;to 
say nothing of the Irish part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the world, Murtagh&mdash;to say nothing of the 
Irish part of it&mdash;will be a fool, even as I have often 
thought it; the grand thing, Murtagh, is to be able to believe 
oneself, and respect oneself.&nbsp; How few whom the world 
believes, believe and respect themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, Shorsha! shall I go on with the tale of 
Finn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you should not, Murtagh; I know all 
about it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you bother me to tell it at first, 
Shorsha?&nbsp; Och, it was doing my ownself good, and making me 
forget my own sorrowful state, when ye interrupted me with your 
thaives of Danes!&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! let me tell you how Finn, 
by means of sucking his thumb, and the witchcraft he imbibed from
it, contrived to pull off the arm of the ould wagabone, Darmod 
David Odeen, whilst shaking hands with him&mdash;for Finn could 
do no feat of strength without sucking his thumb, Shorsha, as 
Conan the Bald told the son of Oisin in the song which I used to 
sing ye in Dungarvon times of old;&rdquo; and here Murtagh 
repeated certain Irish words to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O little the foolish words I heed,<br />
O Oisin&rsquo;s son, from thy lips which come;<br />
No strength were in Finn for valorous deed,<br />
Unless to the gristle he suck&rsquo;d his thumb.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Enough is as good as a feast, Murtagh, I am no longer 
in the cue for Finn.&nbsp; I would rather hear your own 
history.&nbsp; Now, tell us, man, all that has happened to ye 
since Dungarvon times of old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, Shorsha, it would be merely bringing all my 
sorrows back upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I know all your sorrows, perhaps I shall be 
able to find a help for them.&nbsp; I owe you much, Murtagh; you 
taught me Irish, and I will do all I can to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll tell ye my 
history.&nbsp; Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<p>MURTAGH&rsquo;S TALE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Shorsha, about a year and a half after you left 
us&mdash;and a sorrowful hour for us it was when ye left us, 
losing, as we did, your funny stories of your snake&mdash;and the
battles of your military&mdash;they sent me to Paris and 
Salamanca, in order to make a saggart of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for interrupting 
you, but what kind of place is Salamanca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil a bit did I ever see of it, Shorsha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you say you were sent there?&nbsp; Well, 
what kind of place is Paris?&nbsp; Not that I care much about 
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrow a bit did I ever see of either of them, Shorsha,
for no one sent me to either.&nbsp; When we says at home a person
is going to Paris and Salamanca, it manes that he is going abroad
to study to be a saggart, whether he goes to them places or 
not.&nbsp; No, I never saw either&mdash;bad luck to them&mdash;I 
was shipped away from Cork up the straits to a place called 
Leghorn, from which I was sent to . . . to a religious house, 
where I was to be instructed in saggarting till they had made me 
fit to cut a decent figure in Ireland.&nbsp; We had a long and 
tedious voyage, Shorsha; not so tedious, however, as it would 
have been had I been fool enough to lave your pack of cards 
behind me, as the thaif, my brother Denis, wanted to persuade me 
to do, in order that he might play with them himself.&nbsp; With 
the cards I managed to have many a nice game with the sailors, 
winning from them ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences until the 
captain said that I was ruining his men, and keeping them from 
their duty; and, being a heretic and a Dutchman, swore that 
unless I gave over he would tie me up to the mast and give me a 
round dozen.&nbsp; This threat obliged me to be more on my guard,
though I occasionally contrived to get a game at night, and to 
win sixpences and ha&rsquo;pennies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We reached Leghorn at last, and glad I was to leave the
ship and the master, who gave me a kick as I was getting over the
side, bad luck to the dirty heretic for kicking a son of the 
Church, for I have always been a true son of the Church, Shorsha,
and never quarrelled with it unless it interfered with <!-- page 
281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>me
in my playing at cards.&nbsp; I left Leghorn with certain 
muleteers with whom I played at cards at the baiting-houses, and 
who speedily won from me all the ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences I
had won from the sailors.&nbsp; I got my money&rsquo;s worth, 
however, for I learnt from the muleteers all kind of quaint 
tricks upon the cards, which I knew nothing of before; so I did 
not grudge them what they chated me of, and when we parted we did
so in kindness on both sides.&nbsp; On getting to . . . I was 
received into the religious house for Irishes.&nbsp; It was the 
Irish house, Shorsha, into which I was taken, for I do not wish 
ye to suppose that I was in the English religious house which 
there is in that city, in which a purty set are educated, and in 
which purty doings are going on, if all tales be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this Irish house I commenced my studies, learning to
sing and to read the Latin prayers of the church.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, many&rsquo;s the sorrowful day I passed in
that house learning the prayers and litanies, being half-starved,
with no earthly diversion at all, at all; until I took the cards 
out of my chest and began instructing in card-playing the chum 
which I had with me in the cell; then I had plenty of diversion 
along with him during the times when I was not engaged in 
singing, and chanting, and saying the prayers of the church; 
there was, however, some drawback in playing with my chum, for 
though he was very clever in learning, divil a sixpence had he to
play with, in which respect he was like myself, the master who 
taught him, who had lost all my money to the muleteers who taught
me the tricks upon the cards; by degrees, however, it began to be
noised about the religious house that Murtagh, from Hibrodary, <a
name="citation281"></a><a href="#footnote281" 
class="citation">[281]</a> had a pack of cards with which he 
played with his chum in the cell; whereupon other scholars of the
religious house came to me, some to be taught and others to play,
so with some I played, and others I taught, but neither to those 
who could play, or to those who could not, did I teach the 
elegant tricks which I learnt from the muleteers.&nbsp; Well, the
scholars came to me for the sake of the cards, and the porter and
the cook of the religious house, who could both play very well, 
came also; at last I became tired of playing for nothing, so I 
borrowed a few bits of silver from the cook, and played against 
the porter, and by means of my tricks I won money from the 
porter, and then I paid the cook the bits of silver which I had 
borrowed of him; and played with him, and <!-- page 282--><a 
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>won a 
little of his money, which I let him win back again, as I had 
lived long enough in a religious house to know that it is 
dangerous to take money from the cook.&nbsp; In a little time, 
Shorsha, there was scarcely anything going on in the house but 
card-playing; the almoner played with me, and so did the 
sub-rector, and I won money from both; not too much, however, 
lest they should tell the rector, who had the character of a very
austere man, and of being a bit of a saint; however, the thief of
a porter, whose money I had won, informed the rector of what was 
going on, and one day the rector sent for me into his private 
apartment, and gave me so long and pious a lecture upon the 
heinous sin of card-playing, that I thought I should sink into 
the ground; after about half-an-hour&rsquo;s inveighing against 
card-playing, he began to soften his tone, and with a long sigh 
told me that at one time of his life he had been a young man 
himself, and had occasionally used the cards; he then began to 
ask me some questions about card-playing, which questions I 
afterwards found were to pump from me what I knew about the 
science.&nbsp; After a time he asked me whether I had got my 
cards with me, and on my telling him I had, he expressed a wish 
to see them, whereupon I took the pack out of my pocket, and 
showed it to him; he looked at it very attentively, and at last, 
giving another deep sigh, he said, that though he was nearly 
weaned from the vanities of the world, he had still an 
inclination to see whether he had entirely lost the little skill 
which at one time he possessed.&nbsp; When I heard him speak in 
this manner, I told him that if his reverence was inclined for a 
game of cards, I should be very happy to play one with him; 
scarcely had I uttered these words than he gave a third sigh, and
looked so very much like a saint that I was afraid he was going 
to excommunicate me.&nbsp; Nothing of the kind, however, for 
presently he gets up and locks the door, then sitting down at the
table, he motioned me to do the same, which I did, and in five 
minutes there we were playing at cards, his reverence and 
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon found that his reverence knew quite as much 
about card-playing as I did.&nbsp; Divil a trick was there 
connected with cards that his reverence did not seem awake 
to.&nbsp; As, however, we were not playing for money, this 
circumstance did not give me much uneasiness; so we played game 
after game for two hours, when his reverence, having business, 
told me I might go, so I took up my cards, made my obedience, and
left him.&nbsp; <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>The next day I had other games with 
him, and so on for a very long time, still playing for 
nothing.&nbsp; At last his reverence grew tired of playing for 
nothing, and proposed that we should play for money.&nbsp; Now, I
had no desire to play with his reverence for money, as I knew 
that doing so would bring on a quarrel.&nbsp; As long as we were 
playing for nothing, I could afford to let his reverence use what
tricks he pleased; but if we played for money, I couldn&rsquo;t 
do so.&nbsp; If he played his tricks, I must play mine, and use 
every advantage to save my money; and there was one I possessed 
which his reverence did not.&nbsp; The cards being my own, I had 
put some delicate little marks on the trump cards, just at the 
edges, so that when I dealt, by means of a little sleight of hand
I could deal myself any trump card I pleased.&nbsp; But I wished,
as I said before, to have no dealings for money with his 
reverence, knowing that he was master in the house, and that he 
could lead me a dog of a life if I offended him, either by 
winning his money, or not letting him win mine.&nbsp; So I told 
him I had no money to play with, but the ould thief knew better; 
he knew that I was every day winning money from the scholars, and
the sub-rector, and the other people of the house, and the ould 
thief had determined to let me go on in that way winning money, 
and then by means of his tricks, which he thought I dare not 
resent, to win from me all my earnings&mdash;in a word, Shorsha, 
to let me fill myself like a sponge, and then squeeze me for his 
own advantage.&nbsp; So he made me play with him, and in less 
than three days came on the quarrel; his reverence chated me, and
I chated his reverence; the ould thaif knew every trick that I 
knew, and one or two more; but in daling out the cards I nicked 
his reverence; scarcely a trump did I ever give him, Shorsha, and
won his money purty freely.&nbsp; Och, it was a purty 
quarrel!&nbsp; All the delicate names in the &lsquo;Newgate 
Calendar,&rsquo; if ye ever heard of such a book; all the 
hang-dog names in the Newgate histories, and the lives of Irish 
rogues, did we call each other&mdash;his reverence and I!&nbsp; 
Suddenly, however, putting out his hand, he seized the cards, 
saying, &lsquo;I will examine these cards, ye cheating scoundrel!
for I believe there are dirty marks on them, which ye have made 
in order to know the winning cards.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me 
back my pack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or m&rsquo;anam on Dioul if I
be not the death of ye!&rsquo;&nbsp; His reverence, however, 
clapped the cards into his pocket, and made the best of his way 
to the door, I hanging upon him.&nbsp; He was a gross, <!-- page 
284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
284</span>fat man, but like most fat men, deadly strong, so he 
forced his way to the door, and, opening it, flung himself out, 
with me still holding on him like a terrier dog on a big fat pig;
then he shouts for help, and in a little time I was secured and 
thrust into a lock-up room, where I was left to myself.&nbsp; 
Here was a purty alteration.&nbsp; Yesterday I was the idol of 
the religious house, thought more on than his reverence, every 
one paying me court and wurtship, and wanting to play cards with 
me, and to learn my tricks, and fed, moreover, on the tidbits of 
the table; and to-day I was in a cell, nobody coming to look at 
me but the blackguard porter who had charge of me, my cards taken
from me, and with nothing but bread and water to live upon.&nbsp;
Time passed dreary enough for a month, at the end of which time 
his reverence came to me, leaving the porter just outside the 
door in order to come to his help should I be violent; and then 
he read me a very purty lecture on my conduct, saying I had 
turned the religious house topsy-turvy, and corrupted the 
scholars, and that I was the cheat of the world, for that, on 
inspecting the pack, he had discovered the dirty marks which I 
had made upon the trump cards for to know them by.&nbsp; He said 
a great deal more to me, which is not worth relating, and ended 
by telling me that he intended to let me out of confinement next 
day, but that if ever I misconducted myself any more, he would 
clap me in again for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I had a good mind
to call him an ould thaif, but the hope of getting out made me 
hold my tongue, and the next day I was let out; and need enough I
had to be let out, for what with being alone, and living on the 
bread and water, I was becoming frighted, or, as the doctors call
it, narvous.&nbsp; But when I was out&mdash;oh, what a change I 
found in the religious house! no card-playing, for it had been 
forbidden to the scholars, and there was now nothing going on but
reading and singing; divil a merry visage to be seen, but plenty 
of prim airs and graces; but the case of the scholars, though bad
enough, was not half so bad as mine, for they could spake to each
other, whereas I could not have a word of conversation, for the 
ould thaif of a rector had ordered them to send me to 
&lsquo;Coventry,&rsquo; telling them that I was a gambling cheat,
with morals bad enough to corrupt a horse regiment; and whereas 
they were allowed to divert themselves with going out, I was kept
reading and singing from morn till night.&nbsp; The only soul who
was willing to exchange a word with me was the cook, and 
sometimes he and I had a little bit <!-- page 285--><a 
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>of 
discourse in a corner, and we condoled with each other, for he 
liked the change in the religious house almost as little as 
myself; but he told me that, for all the change below stairs, 
there was still card-playing going on above, for that the ould 
thaif of a rector, and the sub-rector, and the almoner played at 
cards together, and that the rector won money from the 
others&mdash;the almoner had told him so&mdash;and, moreover, 
that the rector was the thaif of the world, and had been a 
gambler in his youth, and had once been kicked out of a 
club-house at Dublin for cheating at cards, and after that 
circumstance had apparently reformed and lived decently till the 
time when I came to the religious house with my pack, but that 
the sight of that had brought him back to his ould 
gambling.&nbsp; He told the cook, moreover, that the rector 
frequently went out at night to the houses of the great clergy 
and cheated at cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this melancholy state, with respect to myself, 
things continued a long time, when suddenly there was a report 
that his Holiness the Pope intended to pay a visit to the 
religious house in order to examine into its state of 
discipline.&nbsp; When I heard this I was glad, for I determined,
after the Pope had done what he had come to do, to fall upon my 
knees before him, and make a regular complaint of the treatment I
had received, to tell him of the cheatings at cards of the 
rector, and to beg him to make the ould thaif give me back my 
pack again.&nbsp; So the day of the visit came, and his Holiness 
made his appearance with his attendants, and, having looked over 
the religious house, he went into the rector&rsquo;s room with 
the rector, the sub-rector, and the almoner.&nbsp; I intended to 
have waited until his Holiness came out, but finding he stayed a 
long time, I thought I would e&rsquo;en go in to him, so I went 
up to the door without anybody observing me&mdash;his attendants 
being walking about the corridor&mdash;and opening it I slipped 
in, and there what do you think I saw?&nbsp; Why, his Holiness 
the Pope, and his reverence the rector, and the sub-rector, and 
the almoner seated at cards; and the ould thaif of a rector was 
dealing out the cards which ye had given me, Shorsha, to his 
Holiness the Pope, the sub-rector, the almoner, and 
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this part of his history I interrupted Murtagh, saying that
I was afraid he was telling untruths, and that it was highly 
improbable that the Pope would leave the Vatican to play cards 
with Irish at their religious house, and that I was sure if <!-- 
page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
286</span>on his, Murtagh&rsquo;s authority, I were to tell the 
world so, the world would never believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the world, Shorsha, would be a fool, even as you 
were just now saying you had frequently believed it to be; the 
grand thing, Shorsha, is to be able to believe oneself; if ye can
do that, it matters very little whether the world believes ye or 
no.&nbsp; But a purty thing for you and the world to stickle at 
the Pope&rsquo;s playing at cards at a religious house of Irish; 
och! if I were to tell you, and the world, what the Pope has been
sometimes at, at the religious house of English thaives, I would 
excuse you and the world for turning up your eyes.&nbsp; However,
I wish to say nothing against the Pope.&nbsp; I am a son of the 
Church, and if the Pope don&rsquo;t interfere with my cards, 
divil a bit will I have to say against him; but I saw the Pope 
playing, or about to play, with the pack which had been taken 
from me, and when I told the Pope, the Pope did not . . . ye had 
better let me go on with my history, Shorsha; whither you or the 
world believe it or not, I am sure it is quite as true as your 
tale of the snake, or saying that Finn got his burnt finger from 
the thaives of Loughlin; and whatever you may say, I am sure the 
world will think so too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I apologised to Murtagh for interrupting him, and telling him 
that his history, whether true or not, was infinitely diverting, 
begged him to continue it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
<p>MURTAGH&rsquo;S STORY CONTINUED&mdash;THE PRIEST, EXORCIST, 
AND THIMBLE-ENGRO&mdash;HOW TO CHECK A REBELLION.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was telling ye, Shorsha, when ye interrupted me, that
I found the Pope, the rector, the sub-rector, and the almoner 
seated at the table, the rector, with my pack of cards in his 
hand, about to deal out to the Pope and the rest, not forgetting 
himself, for whom he intended all the trump-cards no doubt.&nbsp;
No sooner did they perceive me than they seemed taken all aback; 
but the rector, suddenly starting up with the cards in his hand, 
asked me what I did there, threatening to have me well 
disciplined if I did not go about my business; &lsquo;I am <!-- 
page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
287</span>come for my pack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;ye ould thaif, 
and to tell his Holiness how I have been treated by ye;&rsquo; 
then, going down on my knees before his Holiness, I said, 
&lsquo;Arrah, now, your Holiness! will ye not see justice done to
a poor boy who has been sadly misused?&nbsp; The pack of cards 
which that old ruffian has in his hand are my cards, which he has
taken from me, in order to chate with.&nbsp; Arrah! don&rsquo;t 
play with him, your Holiness, for he&rsquo;ll only chate 
ye&mdash;there are dirty marks upon the cards which bear the 
trumps, put there in order to know them by; and the ould thaif in
daling out will give himself all the good cards, and chate ye of 
the last farthing in your pocket; so let them be taken from him, 
your Holiness, and given back to me; and order him to lave the 
room, and then, if your Holiness be for an honest game, 
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the boy to baulk ye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take the ould ruffian&rsquo;s place, and play with ye till 
evening, and all night besides, and divil an advantage will I 
take of the dirty marks, though I know them all, having placed 
them on the cards myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was going on in this way
when the ould thaif of a rector, flinging down the cards, made at
me as if to kick me out of the room, whereupon I started up, and 
said, &lsquo;If ye are for kicking, sure two can play at 
that;&rsquo; and then I kicked at his reverence, and his 
reverence at me, and there was a regular scrimmage between us, 
which frightened the Pope, who, getting up, said some words which
I did not understand, but which the cook afterwards told me were,
&lsquo;English extravagance, and this is the second 
edition;&rsquo; for it seems that, a little time before, his 
Holiness had been frightened in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church by the 
servant of an English family, which those thaives of the English 
religious house had been endeavouring to bring over to the 
Catholic faith, and who didn&rsquo;t approve of their being 
converted.&nbsp; Och! his Holiness did us all sore injustice to 
call us English, and to confound our house with the other; for 
however dirty our house might be, our house was a clane house 
compared with the English house, and we honest people compared 
with those English thaives.&nbsp; Well, his Holiness was 
frighted, and the almoner ran out and brought in his 
Holiness&rsquo;s attendants, and they laid hold of me, but I 
struggled hard, and said, &lsquo;I will not go without my pack; 
arrah, your Holiness! make them give me back my pack, which 
Shorsha gave me in Dungarvon times of old;&rsquo; but my 
struggles were of no use.&nbsp; I was pulled away and put in the 
<!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
288</span>ould dungeon, and his Holiness went away sore frighted,
crossing himself much, and never returned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the ould dungeon I was fastened to the wall by a 
chain and there I was disciplined once every other day for the 
first three weeks, and then I was left to myself, and my chain, 
and hunger; and there I sat in the dungeon, sometimes screeching,
sometimes holloaing, for I soon became frighted, having nothing 
in the cell to divert me.&nbsp; At last the cook found his way to
me by stealth, and comforted me a little, bringing me tidbits out
of the kitchen; and he visited me again and again&mdash;not 
often, however, for he dare only come when he could steal away 
the key from the custody of the thief of a porter.&nbsp; I was 
three years in the dungeon, and should have gone mad but for the 
cook, and his words of comfort, and his tidbits, and nice books 
which he brought me out of the library, which were the 
&lsquo;Calendars of Newgate,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Lives of Irish
Rogues and Raparees,&rsquo; the only English books in the 
library.&nbsp; However, at the end of three years, the ould thaif
of a rector, wishing to look at them books, missed them from the 
library, and made a perquisition about them, and the thaif of a 
porter said that he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I had them; saying 
that he had once seen me reading; and then the rector came with 
others to my cell, and took my books from me, from under my 
straw, and asked me how I came by them; and on my refusal to 
tell, they disciplined me again till the blood ran down my back; 
and making more perquisition, they at last accused the cook of 
having carried the books to me, and the cook not denying, he was 
given warning to leave next day, but he left that night, and took
me away with him; for he stole the key, and came to me and cut my
chain through, and then he and I escaped from the religious house
through a window&mdash;the cook with a bundle, containing what 
things he had.&nbsp; No sooner had we got out than the honest 
cook gave me a little bit of money and a loaf, and told me to 
follow a way which he pointed out, which he said would lead to 
the sea; and then, having embraced me after the Italian way, he 
left me, and I never saw him again.&nbsp; So I followed the way 
which the cook pointed out, and in two days reached a sea-port 
called Chiviter Vik, terribly foot-foundered, and there I met a 
sailor who spoke Irish, and who belonged to a vessel just ready 
to sail for France; and the sailor took me on board his vessel, 
and said I was his brother, and the captain gave me a passage to 
a place in France called <!-- page 289--><a 
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Marseilles;
and when I got there, the captain and sailor got a little money 
for me and a passport, and I travelled across the country towards
a place they directed me to called Bayonne, from which they said 
I might, perhaps, get to Ireland.&nbsp; Coming however, to a 
place called Pau, all my money being gone, I enlisted into a 
regiment called the Army of the Faith, which was going into 
Spain, for the King of Spain had been dethroned and imprisoned by
his own subjects, as perhaps you may have heard; and the King of 
France, who was his cousin, was sending an army to help him, 
under the command of his own son, whom the English called Prince 
Hilt, because when he was told that he was appointed to the 
command, he clapped his hand on the hilt of his sword.&nbsp; So I
enlisted into the regiment of the Faith, which was made up of 
Spaniards, many of them priests who had run out of Spain, and 
broken Germans, and foot-foundered Irish, like myself.&nbsp; It 
was said to be a blackguard regiment, that same regiment of the 
Faith; but, &rsquo;faith, I saw nothing blackguardly going on in 
it, for ye would hardly reckon card-playing and dominoes, and 
pitch and toss blackguardly, and I saw nothing else going on in 
it.&nbsp; There was one thing in it which I disliked&mdash;the 
priests drawing their Spanish knives occasionally, when they lost
their money.&nbsp; After we had been some time at Pau, the Army 
of the Faith was sent across the mountains into Spain, as the 
vanguard of the French; and no sooner did the Spaniards see the 
Faith than they made a dash at it, and the Faith ran away, myself
along with it, and got behind the French army, which told it to 
keep there, and the Faith did so, and followed the French army, 
which soon scattered the Spaniards, and in the end placed the 
king on his throne again.&nbsp; When the war was over the Faith 
was disbanded; some of the foreigners, however, amongst whom I 
was one, were put into a Guard regiment, and there I continued 
for more than a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, being at a place called the Escurial, I took 
stock, as the tradesmen say, and found I possessed the sum of 
eighty dollars, won by playing at cards; for though I could not 
play so well with the foreign cards as with the pack ye gave me, 
Shorsha, I had yet contrived to win money from the priests and 
soldiers of the Faith.&nbsp; Finding myself possessed of such a 
capital I determined to leave the service, and to make the best 
of my way to Ireland; so I deserted, but coming in an evil hour 
to a place they calls Torre Lodones, I found the priest <!-- page
290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
290</span>playing at cards with his parishioners.&nbsp; The sight
of the cards made me stop, and then, fool like, notwithstanding 
the treasure I had about me, I must wish to play, so not being 
able to speak their language I made signs to them to let me play,
and the priest and his thaives consented willingly; so I sat down
to cards with the priest and two of his parishioners, and in a 
little time had won plenty of their money, but I had better never
have done any such a thing, for suddenly the priest and all his 
parishioners set upon me and bate me, and took from me all I had,
and cast me out of the village more dead than alive.&nbsp; Och! 
it&rsquo;s a bad village that, and if I had known what it was I 
would have avoided it, or run straight through it, though I saw 
all the card-playing in the world going on in it.&nbsp; There is 
a proverb about it, as I was afterwards told, old as the time of 
the Moors, which holds good to the present day&mdash;it is, that 
in Torre Lodones there are twenty-four housekeepers, and 
twenty-five thieves, maning that all the people are thaives, and 
the clergyman to boot, who is not reckoned a housekeeper; and 
troth I found the clergyman the greatest thaif of the lot.&nbsp; 
After being cast out of that village I travelled for nearly a 
month, subsisting by begging tolerably well, for though most of 
the Spaniards are thaives, they are rather charitable; but though
charitable thaives they do not like their own being taken from 
them without leave being asked, as I found to my cost; for on my 
entering a garden near Seville, without leave, to take an orange,
the labourer came running up and struck me to the ground with a 
hatchet, giving me a big wound in the arm.&nbsp; I fainted with 
loss of blood, and on my reviving I found myself in a hospital at
Seville, to which the labourer and the people of the village had 
taken me.&nbsp; I should have died of starvation in that hospital
had not some English people heard of me and come to see me; they 
tended me with food till I was cured, and then paid my passage on
board a ship to London, to which place the ship carried me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I was in London with five shillings in my 
pocket&mdash;all I had in the world&mdash;and that did not last 
for long; and when it was gone I begged in the streets, but I did
not get much by that, except a month&rsquo;s hard labour in the 
correction-house; and when I came out I knew not what to do, but 
thought I would take a walk in the country, for it was 
springtime, and the weather was fine, so I took a walk about 
seven miles from London, and came to a place where a great fair 
was <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>being held; and there I begged, but 
got nothing but a half-penny, and was thinking of going farther, 
when I saw a man with a table, like that of mine, playing with 
thimbles, as you saw me.&nbsp; I looked at the play, and saw him 
win money and run away, and hunted by constables more than 
once.&nbsp; I kept following the man, and at last entered into 
conversation with him; and learning from him that he was in want 
of a companion to help him, I offered to help him if he would pay
me; he looked at me from top to toe, and did not wish at first to
have anything to do with me, as he said my appearance was against
me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, he had better have looked at 
home, for his appearance was not much in his favour: he looked 
very much like a Jew, Shorsha.&nbsp; However, he at last agreed 
to take me to be his companion, or bonnet as he called it; and I 
was to keep a look-out, and let him know when constables were 
coming, and to spake a good word for him occasionally, whilst he 
was chating folks with his thimbles and his pea.&nbsp; So I 
became his bonnet, and assisted him in the fair, and in many 
other fairs beside; but I did not like my occupation much, or 
rather my master, who, though not a big man, was a big thaif, and
an unkind one, for do all I could I could never give him 
pleasure; and he was continually calling me fool and bogtrotter, 
and twitting me because I could not learn his thaives&rsquo; 
Latin, and discourse with him in it, and comparing me with 
another acquaintance, or bit of a pal of his, whom he said he had
parted with in the fair, and of whom he was fond of saying all 
kinds of wonderful things, amongst others, that he knew the 
grammar of all tongues.&nbsp; At last, wearied with being twitted
by him with not being able to learn his thaives&rsquo; Greek, I 
proposed that I should teach him Irish, that we should spake it 
together when we had anything to say in sacret.&nbsp; To that he 
consented willingly; but, och! a purty hand he made with Irish, 
&rsquo;faith, not much better than did I with his thaives&rsquo; 
Hebrew.&nbsp; Then my turn came, and I twitted him nicely with 
dulness, and compared him with a pal that I had in ould Ireland, 
in Dungarvon times of yore, to whom I teached Irish, telling him 
that he was the broth of a boy, and not only knew the grammar of 
all human tongues, but the dialects of the snakes besides; in 
fact, I tould him all about your own sweet self, Shorsha, and 
many a dispute and quarrel had we together about our pals, which 
was the cleverest fellow, his or mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after having been wid him about two months, I 
quitted <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>him without noise, taking away one 
of his tables, and some peas and thimbles; and that I did with a 
safe conscience, for he paid me nothing, and was not over free 
with the meat and the drink, though I must say of him that he was
a clever fellow, and perfect master of his trade, by which he 
made a power of money, and bating his not being able to learn 
Irish, and a certain Jewish lisp which he had, a great master of 
his tongue, of which he was very proud; so much so, that he once 
told me that when he had saved a certain sum of money he meant to
leave off the thimbling business, and enter Parliament; into 
which, he said, he could get at any time, through the interest of
a friend of his, a Tory Peer&mdash;my Lord Whitefeather, with 
whom, he said, he had occasionally done business.&nbsp; With the 
table, and other things which I had taken, I commenced trade on 
my own account, having contrived to learn a few of his 
tricks.&nbsp; My only capital was the change for half-a-guinea, 
which he had once let fall, and which I picked up, which was all 
I could ever get from him: for it was impossible to stale any 
money from him, he was so awake, being up to all the tricks of 
thaives, having followed the diving trade, as he called it, for a
considerable time.&nbsp; My wish was to make enough by my table 
to enable me to return with credit to ould Ireland, where I had 
no doubt of being able to get myself ordained as priest; and, in 
troth, notwithstanding I was a beginner, and without any 
companion to help me, I did tolerably well, getting my meat and 
drink, and increasing my small capital, till I came to this 
unlucky place of Horncastle, where I was utterly ruined by the 
thaif in the rider&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; And now, Shorsha, I am 
after telling you my history; perhaps you will now be telling me 
something about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told Murtagh all about myself that I deemed necessary to 
relate, and then asked him what he intended to do; he repeated 
that he was utterly ruined, and that he had no prospect before 
him but starving, or making away with himself.&nbsp; I inquired 
&ldquo;How much would take him to Ireland, and establish him 
there with credit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Five pounds,&rdquo; he 
answered, adding, &ldquo;but who in the world would be fool 
enough to lend me five pounds, unless it be yourself, Shorsha, 
who, may be, have not got it; for when you told me about 
yourself, you made no boast of the state of your 
affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not very rich,&rdquo; I 
replied, &ldquo;but I think I can accommodate you with what you 
want.&nbsp; I consider myself under great obligations to you, 
<!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
293</span>Murtagh; it was you who instructed me in the language 
of Oilein nan Naomha, which has been the foundation of all my 
acquisitions in philology; without you I should not be what I 
am&mdash;Lavengro! which signifies a philologist.&nbsp; Here is 
the money, Murtagh,&rdquo; said I, putting my hand into my pocket
and taking out five pounds; &ldquo;much good may it do 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took the money, stared at it, and then at 
me&mdash;&ldquo;And you mane to give me this, 
Shorsha?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no longer mine to give,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it is yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you give it 
me for the gratitude you bear me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and for Dungarvon times of old.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, Shorsha,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a broth of a
boy, and I&rsquo;ll take your benefaction&mdash;five pounds! och,
Jasus!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then put the money in his pocket, and 
springing up, waved his hat three times, uttering some old Irish 
cry; then, sitting down, he took my hand and said, &ldquo;Sure, 
Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll be going thither; and when I get there, it is
turning over another leaf I will be; I have learnt a thing or two
abroad; I will become a priest; that&rsquo;s the trade, Shorsha! 
and I will cry out for repale; that&rsquo;s the cry, Shorsha! and
I&rsquo;ll be a fool no longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what will
you do with your table?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Faith,
I&rsquo;ll be taking it with me, Shorsha; and when I gets to 
Ireland, I&rsquo;ll get it mended, and I will keep it in the 
house which I shall have; and when I looks upon it, I will be 
thinking of all I have undergone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had 
better leave it behind you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you take it 
with you, you will perhaps take up the thimble trade again before
you get to Ireland, and lose the money I am after giving 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No fear of that, Shorsha; never will I 
play on that table again, Shorsha, till I get it mended, which 
shall not be till I am a priest, and have a house in which to 
place it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murtagh and I then went into the town, where we had some 
refreshment together, and then parted on our several ways.&nbsp; 
I heard nothing of him for nearly a quarter of a century, when a 
person who knew him well, coming from Ireland, and staying at my 
humble house, told me a great deal about him.&nbsp; He reached 
Ireland in safety, soon reconciled himself with his Church, and 
was ordained a priest; in the priestly office he acquitted 
himself in a way very satisfactory, upon the whole, to his 
superiors, having, as he frequently said, learned wisdom 
abroad.&nbsp; The Popish Church never fails to turn to account 
any particular gift which its servants may possess; and 
discovering soon that Murtagh was endowed with <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
294</span>considerable manual dexterity&mdash;proof of which he 
frequently gave at cards, and at a singular game which he 
occasionally played with thimbles&mdash;it selected him as a very
fit person to play the part of exorcist; and accordingly he 
travelled through a great part of Ireland, casting out devils 
from people possessed, which he afterwards exhibited, sometimes 
in the shape of rabbits, and occasionally birds and fish.&nbsp; 
There is a holy island in a lake in Ireland, to which the people 
resort at a particular season of the year.&nbsp; Here Murtagh 
frequently attended, and it was here that he performed a cure 
which will cause his name long to be remembered in Ireland, 
delivering a possessed woman of two demons, which he brandished 
aloft in his hands, in the shape of two large eels, and 
subsequently hurled into the lake, amidst the shouts of an 
enthusiastic multitude.&nbsp; Besides playing the part of an 
exorcist, he acted that of a politician with considerable 
success; he attached himself to the party of the sire of 
agitation&mdash;&ldquo;the man of paunch,&rdquo; and preached and
hallooed for repeal with the loudest and best, as long as repeal 
was the cry; as soon, however, as the Whigs attained the helm of 
Government, and the greater part of the loaves and 
fishes&mdash;more politely termed the patronage of 
Ireland&mdash;was placed at the disposition of the priesthood, 
the tone of Murtagh, like that of the rest of his brother 
saggarts, was considerably softened; he even went so far as to 
declare that politics were not altogether consistent with 
sacerdotal duty; and resuming his exorcisms, which he had for 
some time abandoned, he went to the Isle of Holiness, and 
delivered a possessed woman of six demons in the shape of white 
mice.&nbsp; He, however, again resumed the political mantle in 
the year 1848, during the short period of the rebellion of the 
so-called Young Irelanders.&nbsp; The priests, though they 
apparently sided with this party, did not approve of it, as it 
was chiefly formed of ardent young men, fond of what they termed 
liberty, and by no means admirers of priestly domination, being 
mostly Protestants.&nbsp; Just before the outbreak of this 
rebellion, it was determined between the priests and the . . ., 
that this party should be rendered comparatively innocuous by 
being deprived of the sinews of war&mdash;in other words, certain
sums of money which they had raised for their enterprise.&nbsp; 
Murtagh was deemed the best qualified person in Ireland to be 
entrusted with the delicate office of getting their money from 
them.&nbsp; Having received his <!-- page 295--><a 
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
295</span>instructions, he invited the leaders to his parsonage 
amongst the mountains, under pretence of deliberating with them 
about what was to be done.&nbsp; They arrived there just before 
nightfall, dressed in red, yellow, and green, the colours so dear
to enthusiastic Irishmen; Murtagh received them with great 
apparent cordiality, and entered into a long discourse with them,
promising them the assistance of himself and order, and received 
from them a profusion of thanks.&nbsp; After a time Murtagh, 
observing in a jocular tone that consulting was dull work, 
proposed a game of cards, and the leaders, though somewhat 
surprised, assenting, he went to a closet, and taking out a pack 
of cards, laid it upon the table; it was a strange dirty pack, 
and exhibited every mark of having seen very long service.&nbsp; 
On one of his guests making some remarks on the 
&ldquo;ancientness&rdquo; of its appearance, Murtagh observed 
that there was a very wonderful history attached to that pack; it
had been presented to him, he said, by a young gentleman, a 
disciple of his, to whom, in Dungarvon times of yore, he had 
taught the Irish language, and of whom he related some very 
extraordinary things; he added that he, Murtagh, had taken it to 
. . ., where it had once the happiness of being in the hands of 
the Holy Father; by a great misfortune, he did not say what, he 
had lost possession of it, and had returned without it, but had 
some time since recovered it; a nephew of his, who was being 
educated at . . . for a priest, having found it in a nook of the 
college, and sent it to him.</p>
<p>Murtagh and the leaders then played various games with this 
pack, more especially one called by the initiated &ldquo;blind 
hookey,&rdquo; the result being that at the end of about two 
hours the leaders found they had lost one-half of their funds; 
they now looked serious, and talked of leaving the house, but 
Murtagh begging them to stay to supper, they consented.&nbsp; 
After supper, at which the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh 
said that, as he had not the least wish to win their money, he 
intended to give them their revenge; he would not play at cards 
with them, he added, but at a funny game of thimbles, at which 
they would be sure of winning back their own; then going out, he 
brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing certain 
thimbles and a pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever 
they pleased on the almost certainty of finding the pea under the
thimbles.&nbsp; The leaders, after some hesitation, consented, 
and were at first eminently successful, winning back <!-- page 
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
296</span>the greater part of what they had lost; after some 
time, however, Fortune, or rather Murtagh, turned against them, 
and then instead of leaving off, they doubled and trebled their 
stakes, and continued doing so until they had lost nearly the 
whole of their funds.&nbsp; Quite furious, they now swore that 
Murtagh had cheated them, and insisted on having their property 
restored to them.&nbsp; Murtagh, without a word of reply, went to
the door, and shouting into the passage something in Irish, the 
room was instantly filled with bogtrotters, each at least six 
feet high, with a stout shillealah in his hand.&nbsp; Murtagh 
then, turning to his guests, asked them what they meant by 
insulting an anointed priest; telling them that it was not for 
the likes of them to avenge the wrongs of Ireland.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been clane mistaken in the whole of ye,&rdquo; said he; 
&ldquo;I supposed ye Irish, but have found, to my sorrow, that ye
are nothing of the kind; purty fellows to pretend to be Irish, 
when there is not a word of Irish on the tongue of any of ye, 
divil a ha&rsquo;porth; the illigant young gentleman to whom I 
taught Irish, in Dungarvon times of old, though not born in 
Ireland, has more Irish in him than any ten of ye.&nbsp; He is 
the boy to avenge the wrongs of Ireland, if ever foreigner is to 
do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then saying something to the bogtrotters, 
they instantly cleared the room of the young Irelanders, who 
retired sadly disconcerted; nevertheless, being very silly young 
fellows, they hoisted the standard of rebellion; few, however, 
joining them, partly because they had no money, and partly 
because the priests abused them with might and main, their 
rebellion ended in a lamentable manner; themselves being seized 
and tried, and though convicted, not deemed of sufficient 
importance to be sent to the scaffold, where they might have had 
the satisfaction of saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dulce et decorum est pro patri&acirc; 
mori.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My visitor, after saying that of the money won, Murtagh 
retained a considerable portion, that a part went to the 
hierarchy for what were called church purposes, and that the . . 
. took the remainder, which it employed in establishing a 
newspaper, in which the private characters of the worthiest and 
most loyal Protestants in Ireland were traduced and vilified, 
concluded his account by observing, that it was the common belief
that Murtagh, having by his services, ecclesiastical and 
political, acquired the confidence of the priesthood and favour 
<!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

appointed to the high office of Popish Primate of Ireland.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
<p>DEPARTURE FROM HORNCASTLE&mdash;RECRUITING 
SERGEANT&mdash;KAULOES AND LOLLOES.</p>
<p>Leaving Horncastle, I bent my steps in the direction of the 
east.&nbsp; I walked at a brisk rate, and late in the evening 
reached a large town, situate at the entrance of an extensive 
firth, or arm of the sea, which prevented my farther progress 
eastward.&nbsp; Sleeping that night in the suburbs of the town, I
departed early next morning in the direction of the south.&nbsp; 
A walk of about twenty miles brought me to another large town, 
situated on a river, where I again turned towards the east.&nbsp;
At the end of the town I was accosted by a fiery-faced 
individual, somewhat under the middle size, dressed as a 
recruiting sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant, 
&ldquo;you are just the kind of person to serve the Honourable 
East India Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather the Honourable Company should serve 
me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, young man.&nbsp; Well, the Honourable East 
India Company shall serve you&mdash;that&rsquo;s 
reasonable.&nbsp; Here, take this shilling; &rsquo;tis 
service-money.&nbsp; The Honourable Company engages to serve you,
and you the Honourable Company; both parties shall be thus 
served; that&rsquo;s just and reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what must I do for the Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only go to India; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what should I do in India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight, my brave boy! fight, my youthful 
hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of country is India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finest country in the world!&nbsp; Rivers, bigger 
than the Ouse.&nbsp; Hills, higher than anything near 
Spalding!&nbsp; Trees&mdash;you never saw such trees!&nbsp; 
Fruits&mdash;you never saw such fruits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the people&mdash;what kind of folk are 
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&nbsp; Kauloes&mdash;blacks&mdash;a set of rascals 
not worth regarding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kauloes!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;blacks!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant; 
&ldquo;and they call us lolloes, which, in their beastly 
gibberish, means reds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolloes!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;reds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant, 
&ldquo;kauloes and lolloes; and all the lolloes have to do is to 
kick and cut down the kauloes, and take from them their rupees, 
which mean silver money.&nbsp; Why do you stare so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is the very language of
Mr. Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pet . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and Tawno Chikno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawno Chik . . .?&nbsp; I say, young fellow, I 
don&rsquo;t like your way of speaking; no, nor your way of 
looking.&nbsp; You are mad, sir; you are mad; and what&rsquo;s 
this?&nbsp; Why, your hair is grey!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t do for 
the Honourable Company&mdash;they like red.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad 
I didn&rsquo;t give you the shilling.&nbsp; Good day to 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I, as I proceeded
rapidly along a broad causeway, in the direction of the east, 
&ldquo;if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally from 
India.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo;</p>

class="pagenum">p. 299</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; A WORD FOR LAVENGRO.</h3>
<p>Lavengro is the history up to a certain period of one of 
rather a peculiar mind and system of nerves, with an exterior shy
and cold, under which lurk much curiosity, especially with regard
to what is wild and extraordinary, a considerable quantity of 
energy and industry, and an unconquerable love of 
independence.&nbsp; It narrates his earliest dreams and feelings,
dwells with minuteness on the ways, words, and characters of his 
father, mother, and brother, lingers on the occasional 
resting-places of his wandering, half-military childhood, 
describes the gradual hardening of his bodily frame by robust 
exercises, his successive struggles, after his family and himself
have settled down in a small local capital, to obtain knowledge 
of every kind, but more particularly philological lore; his 
visits to the tent of the Romany chal, and the parlour of the 
Anglo-German philosopher; the effect produced upon his character 
by his flinging himself into contact with people all widely 
differing from each other, but all extraordinary; his reluctance 
to settle down to the ordinary pursuits of life; his struggles 
after moral truth; his glimpses of God and the obscuration of the
Divine Being to his mind&rsquo;s eye; and his being cast upon the
world of London by the death of his father, at the age of 
nineteen.&nbsp; In the world within a world, the world of London,
it shows him playing his part for some time as he best can, in 
the capacity of a writer for reviews and magazines, and describes
what he saw and underwent whilst labouring in that capacity; it 
represents him, however, as never forgetting that he is the son 
of a brave but poor gentleman, and that if he is a hack author, 
he is likewise a scholar.&nbsp; It shows him doing no 
dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he occasionally associates
with low characters, he does so chiefly to gratify the curiosity 
of a scholar.</p>
<p>In his conversations with the apple-woman of London Bridge, 
the scholar is ever apparent, so again in his acquaintance with 
the man <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>of the table, for the book is no 
raker up of the uncleanness of London, and if it gives what at 
first sight appears refuse, it invariably shows that a pearl of 
some kind, generally a philological one, is contained amongst it;
it shows its hero always accompanied by his love of independence,
scorning in the greatest poverty to receive favours from anybody,
and describes him finally rescuing himself from peculiarly 
miserable circumstances by writing a book, an original book, 
within a week, even as Johnson is said to have written his 
&ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; and Beckford his &ldquo;Vathek,&rdquo; 
and tells how, leaving London, he betakes himself to the roads 
and fields.</p>
<p>In the country it shows him leading a life of roving 
adventure, becoming tinker, gypsy, postillion, ostler; 
associating with various kinds of people, chiefly of the lower 
classes, whose ways and habits are described; but, though leading
this erratic life, we gather from the book that his habits are 
neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still follows to a certain 
extent his favourite pursuits, hunting after strange characters, 
or analysing strange words and names.&nbsp; At the conclusion of 
Chapter XLVII., which terminates the first part of the history, 
it hints that he is about to quit his native land on a grand 
philological expedition.</p>
<p>Those who read this book with attention&mdash;and the author 
begs to observe that it would be of little utility to read it 
hurriedly&mdash;may derive much information with respect to 
matters of philology and literature; it will be found treating of
most of the principal languages from Ireland to China, and of the
literature which they contain; and it is particularly minute with
regard to the ways, manners, and speech of the English section of
the most extraordinary and mysterious clan or tribe of people to 
be found in the whole world&mdash;the children of Roma.&nbsp; But
it contains matters of much more importance than anything in 
connection with philology, and the literature and manners of 
nations.&nbsp; Perhaps no work was ever offered to the public in 
which the kindness and providence of God have been set forth by 
more striking examples, or the machinations of priestcraft been 
more truly and lucidly exposed, or the dangers which result to a 
nation when it abandons itself to effeminacy, and a rage for what
is novel and fashionable, than the present.</p>
<p>With respect to the kindness and providence of God, are they 
not exemplified in the case of the old apple-woman and her 
son.&nbsp; These are beings in many points bad, but with warm 
affections, who, after an agonising separation, are restored to 
each other, but not until the hearts of both are changed and 
purified by the influence of affliction.&nbsp; Are they not 
exemplified in the case of the rich gentleman, who touches 
objects in order to avert the evil chance?&nbsp; This being has 
great gifts and many amiable qualities, but does not everybody 
see that his besetting sin is selfishness.&nbsp; He fixes his 
mind on certain objects, and takes inordinate interest in them, 
because they are his own, and those very objects, through <!-- 
page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
301</span>the providence of God, which is kindness in disguise, 
become snakes and scorpions to whip him.&nbsp; Tired of various 
pursuits, he at last becomes an author, and publishes a book, 
which is very much admired, and which he loves with his usual 
inordinate affection; the book, consequently, becomes a viper to 
him, and at last he flings it aside and begins another; the book,
however, is not flung aside by the world, who are benefited by 
it, deriving pleasure and knowledge from it; so the man who 
merely wrote to gratify self, has already done good to others, 
and got himself an honourable name.&nbsp; But God will not allow 
that man to put that book under his head and use it as a pillow: 
the book has become a viper to him, he has banished it, and is 
about another, which he finishes and gives to the world; it is a 
better book than the first, and every one is delighted with it; 
but it proves to the writer a scorpion, because he loves it with 
inordinate affection; but it was good for the world that he 
produced this book, which stung him as a scorpion.&nbsp; Yes; and
good for himself, for the labour of writing it amused him, and 
perhaps prevented him from dying of apoplexy; but the book is 
banished, and another is begun, and herein, again, is the 
providence of God manifested; the man has the power of producing 
still, and God determines that he shall give to the world what 
remains in his brain, which he would not do, had he been 
satisfied with the second work; he would have gone to sleep upon 
that as he would upon the first, for the man is selfish and 
lazy.&nbsp; In his account of what he suffered during the 
composition of this work, his besetting sin of selfishness is 
manifest enough; the work on which he is engaged occupies his 
every thought, it is his idol, his deity, it shall be all his 
own, he won&rsquo;t borrow a thought from any one else; and he is
so afraid lest, when he publishes it, that it should be thought 
that he had borrowed from any one, that he is continually 
touching objects, his nervous system, owing to his extreme 
selfishness, having become partly deranged.&nbsp; He is left 
touching, in order to banish the evil chance from his book, his 
deity.&nbsp; No more of his history is given; but does the reader
think that God will permit that man to go to sleep on his third 
book, however extraordinary it may be?&nbsp; Assuredly not.&nbsp;
God will not permit that man to rest till he has cured him to a 
certain extent of his selfishness, which has, however, hitherto 
been very useful to the world.</p>
<p>Then, again, in the tale of Peter Williams, is not the hand of
Providence to be seen?&nbsp; This person commits a sin in his 
childhood, utters words of blasphemy, the remembrance of which, 
in after life, preying upon his imagination, unfits him for quiet
pursuits, to which he seems to have been naturally inclined; but 
for the remembrance of that sin, he would have been Peter 
Williams the quiet, respectable Welsh farmer, somewhat fond of 
reading the ancient literature of his country in winter evenings,
after his work was done.&nbsp; God, however, was aware that there
was something in <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Peter Williams to entitle him to 
assume a higher calling; he therefore permits this sin, which, 
though a childish affair, was yet a sin and committed 
deliberately, to prey upon his mind till he becomes at last an 
instrument in the hand of God, a humble Paul, the great preacher,
Peter Williams, who, though he considers himself a reprobate and 
a castaway, instead of having recourse to drinking in mad 
desperation, as many do who consider themselves reprobates, goes 
about Wales and England preaching the word of God, dilating on 
His power and majesty, and visiting the sick and afflicted, until
God sees fit to restore to him his peace of mind; which He does 
not do, however, until that mind is in a proper condition to 
receive peace, till it has been purified by the pain of the one 
idea which has so long been permitted to riot in his brain; which
pain, however, an angel, in the shape of a gentle, faithful wife,
had occasionally alleviated; for God is merciful even in the 
blows which He bestoweth, and will not permit any one to be 
tempted beyond the measure which he can support.&nbsp; And here 
it will be as well for the reader to ponder upon the means by 
which the Welsh preacher is relieved from his mental misery: he 
is not relieved by a text from the Bible, by the words of 
consolation and wisdom addressed to him by his angel-minded wife,
nor by the preaching of one yet more eloquent than himself; but 
by a quotation made by Lavengro from the life of Mary Flanders, 
cut-purse and prostitute, which life Lavengro had been in the 
habit of reading at the stall of his old friend the apple-woman, 
on London Bridge, who had herself been very much addicted to the 
perusal of it, though without any profit whatever.&nbsp; Should 
the reader be dissatisfied with the manner in which Peter 
Williams is made to find relief, the author would wish to answer,
that the Almighty frequently accomplishes His purposes by means 
which appear very singular to the eyes of men, and at the same 
time to observe that the manner in which that relief is obtained,
is calculated to read a lesson to the proud, fanciful, and 
squeamish, who are ever in a fidget lest they should be thought 
to mix in low society, or to bestow a moment&rsquo;s attention on
publications which are not what is called of a perfectly 
unobjectionable character.&nbsp; Had not Lavengro formed the 
acquaintance of the old apple-woman on London Bridge, he would 
not have had an opportunity of reading the life of Mary Flanders;
and, consequently, of storing in a memory which never forgets 
anything, a passage which contained a balm for the agonised mind 
of poor Peter Williams.&nbsp; The best medicines are not always 
found in the finest shops.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, if, 
instead of going to London Bridge to read, he had gone to 
Albemarle Street, and had received from the proprietors of the 
literary establishment in that very fashionable street permission
to read the publications on the tables of the saloons there, does
the reader think he would have met any balm in those publications
for the case of Peter Williams? does the reader suppose that he 
would have found Mary Flanders there?&nbsp; <!-- page 303--><a 
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>He would 
certainly have found that highly unobjectionable publication, 
&ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;Lives of Royal and Illustrious Personages,&rdquo; but, of 
a surety, no Mary Flanders; so when Lavengro met with Peter 
Williams, he would have been unprovided with a balm to cure his 
ulcerated mind, and have parted from him in a way not quite so 
satisfactory as the manner in which he took his leave of him; for
it is certain that he might have read &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; and
all the other unexceptionable works to be found in the library of
Albemarle Street, over and over again, before he would have found
any cure in them for the case of Peter Williams.&nbsp; Therefore 
the author requests the reader to drop any squeamish nonsense he 
may wish to utter about Mary Flanders, and the manner in which 
Peter Williams was cured.</p>
<p>And now with respect to the old man who knew Chinese, but 
could not tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; This individual was 
a man whose natural powers would have been utterly buried and 
lost beneath a mountain of sloth and laziness, had not God 
determined otherwise.&nbsp; He had in his early years chalked out
for himself a plan of life in which he had his own ease and 
self-indulgence solely in view; he had no particular bad passions
to gratify, he only wished to lead an easy, quiet life, just as 
if the business of this mighty world could be carried on by 
innocent people fond of ease and quiet, or that Providence would 
permit innocent, quiet drones to occupy any portion of the earth 
and to cumber it.&nbsp; God had at any rate decreed that this man
should not cumber it as a drone.&nbsp; He brings a certain 
affliction upon him, the agony of which produces that terrible 
whirling of the brain which, unless it is stopped in time, 
produces madness; he suffers indescribable misery for a period, 
until one morning his attention is arrested, and his curiosity is
aroused, by certain Chinese letters on a teapot; his curiosity 
increases more and more, and, of course, in proportion as his 
curiosity is increased with respect to the Chinese marks, the 
misery in his brain, produced by his mental affliction, 
decreases.&nbsp; He sets about learning Chinese, and after the 
lapse of many years, during which his mind subsides into a 
certain state of tranquillity, he acquires sufficient knowledge 
of Chinese to be able to translate with ease the inscriptions to 
be found on its singular crockery.&nbsp; Yes, the laziest of 
human beings, through the providence of God, a being too of 
rather inferior capacity, acquires the written part of a language
so difficult that, as Lavengro said on a former occasion, none 
but the cleverest people in Europe, the French, are able to 
acquire it.&nbsp; But God did not intend that man should merely 
acquire Chinese.&nbsp; He intended that he should be of use to 
his species, and by the instrumentality of the first Chinese 
inscription which he translates, the one which first arrested his
curiosity, he is taught the duties of hospitality; yes, by means 
of an inscription in the language of a people who have scarcely 
an idea of hospitality themselves, God causes the slothful man to
play a useful and beneficent part in the world, relieving <!-- 
page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
304</span>distressed wanderers, and, amongst others, Lavengro 
himself.&nbsp; But a striking indication of the man&rsquo;s 
surprising sloth is still apparent in what he omits to do; he has
learnt Chinese, the most difficult of languages, and he practises
acts of hospitality, because he believes himself enjoined to do 
so by the Chinese inscription, but he cannot tell the hour of the
day by the clock within his house; he can get on, he thinks, very
well without being able to do so; therefore, from this one 
omission, it is easy to come to a conclusion as to what a 
sluggard&rsquo;s part the man would have played in life, but for 
the dispensation of Providence; nothing but extreme agony could 
have induced such a man to do anything useful.&nbsp; He still 
continues, with all he has acquired, with all his usefulness, and
with all his innocence of character, without any proper sense of 
religion, though he has attained a rather advanced age.&nbsp; If 
it be observed that this want of religion is a great defect in 
the story, the author begs leave to observe that he cannot help 
it.&nbsp; Lavengro relates the lives of people so far as they 
were placed before him, but no farther.&nbsp; It was certainly a 
great defect in so good a man to be without religion; it was 
likewise a great defect in so learned a man not to be able to 
tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is probable that God, in 
his loving kindness, will not permit that man to go out of the 
world without religion; who knows but some powerful minister of 
the Church, full of zeal for the glory of God, will illume that 
man&rsquo;s dark mind; perhaps some clergyman will come to the 
parish who will visit him and teach him his duty to his 
God.&nbsp; Yes, it is very probable that such a man, before he 
dies, will have been made to love his God; whether he will ever 
learn to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, is another 
matter.&nbsp; It is probable that he will go out of the world 
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is not so 
necessary to be able to tell the time of day by the clock as to 
know one&rsquo;s God through his inspired word; a man cannot get 
to heaven without religion, but a man can get there very 
comfortably without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>But, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested 
in the case of Lavengro himself, by the manner in which he is 
enabled to make his way in the world up to a certain period, 
without falling a prey either to vice or poverty.&nbsp; In his 
history there is a wonderful illustration of part of the text 
quoted by his mother, &ldquo;I have been young, and now am old, 
yet never saw I the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging 
bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the son of good and honourable parents,
but at the critical period of life, that of entering into the 
world, he finds himself without any earthly friend to help him, 
yet he manages to make his way; he does not become a Captain in 
the Life Guards, it is true, nor does he get into Parliament, nor
does the last chapter conclude in the most satisfactory and 
unobjectionable manner, by his marrying a dowager countess, as 
that wise man Addison did, or by his settling down as a great 
country gentleman, perfectly happy and contented, like the very 
moral Roderick <!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Random, or the equally estimable 
Peregrine Pickle; he is hack author, gypsy, tinker, and 
postillion, yet, upon the whole, he seems to be quite as happy as
the younger sons of most earls, to have as high feelings of 
honour; and when the reader loses sight of him, he has money in 
his pocket honestly acquired, to enable him to commence a journey
quite as laudable as those which the younger sons of earls 
generally undertake.&nbsp; Surely all this is a manifestation of 
the kindness and providence of God: and yet he is not a religious
person; up to the time when the reader loses sight of him, he is 
decidedly not a religious person; he has glimpses, it is true, of
that God who does not forsake him, but he prays very seldom, is 
not fond of going to church; and, though he admires Tate and 
Brady&rsquo;s version of the Psalms, his admiration is rather 
caused by the beautiful poetry which that version contains than 
the religion; yet his tale is not finished&mdash;like the tale of
the gentleman who touched objects, and that of the old man who 
knew Chinese without knowing what was o&rsquo;clock; perhaps, 
like them, he is destined to become religious, and to have, 
instead of occasional glimpses, frequent and distinct views of 
his God; yet, though he may become religious, it is hardly to be 
expected that he will become a very precise and strait-laced 
person; it is probable that he will retain, with his scholarship,
something of his gypsyism, his predilection for the hammer and 
tongs, and perhaps some inclination to put on certain gloves, not
white kid, with any friend who may be inclined for a little old 
English diversion, and a readiness to take a glass of ale, with 
plenty of malt in it, and as little hop as may well be&mdash;ale 
at least two years old&mdash;with the aforesaid friend, when the 
diversion is over; for, as it is the belief of the writer that a 
person may get to heaven very comfortably without knowing 
what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, so it is his belief that he will not 
be refused admission there because to the last he has been fond 
of healthy and invigorating exercises, and felt a willingness to 
partake of any of the good things which it pleases the Almighty 
to put within the reach of His children during their sojourn upon
earth.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; ON PRIESTCRAFT.</h3>
<p>The writer will now say a few words about priestcraft, and the
machinations of Rome, and will afterwards say something about 
himself, and his motives for writing against them.</p>
<p>With respect to Rome and her machinations, much valuable 
information can be obtained from particular parts of Lavengro and
its sequel.&nbsp; Shortly before the time when the hero of the 
book is launched into the world, the Popish agitation in England 
had commenced.&nbsp; <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>The Popish propaganda had determined
to make a grand attempt on England; Popish priests were scattered
over the land, doing the best they could to make converts to the 
old superstition.&nbsp; With the plans of Rome, and her hopes, 
and the reasons on which those hopes are grounded, the hero of 
the book becomes acquainted during an expedition which he makes 
into the country, from certain conversations which he holds with 
a priest in a dingle, in which the hero had taken up his 
residence; he likewise learns from the same person much of the 
secret history of the Roman See, and many matters connected with 
the origin and progress of the Popish superstition.&nbsp; The 
individual with whom he holds these conversations is a learned, 
intelligent, but highly-unprincipled person, of a character 
however very common amongst the priests of Rome, who in general 
are people void of all religion, and who, notwithstanding they 
are tied to Rome by a band which they have neither the power nor 
wish to break, turn her and her practices, over their cups with 
their confidential associates, to a ridicule only exceeded by 
that to which they turn those who become the dupes of their 
mistress and themselves.</p>
<p>It is now necessary that the writer should say something with 
respect to himself, and his motives for waging war against 
Rome.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to himself, he wishes to 
state, that to the very last moment of his life, he will do and 
say all that in his power may be to hold up to contempt and 
execration the priestcraft and practices of Rome; there is, 
perhaps, no person better acquainted than himself, not even among
the choicest spirits of the priesthood, with the origin and 
history of Popery.&nbsp; From what he saw and heard of Popery in 
England, at a very early period of his life, his curiosity was 
aroused, and he spared himself no trouble, either by travel or 
study, to make himself well acquainted with it in all its phases,
the result being a hatred of it, which he hopes and trusts he 
shall retain till the moment when his spirit quits the 
body.&nbsp; Popery is the great lie of the world; a source from 
which more misery and social degradation have flowed upon the 
human race, than from all the other sources from which those 
evils come.&nbsp; It is the oldest of all superstitions; and 
though in Europe it assumes the name of Christianity, it existed 
and flourished amidst the Himalayan hills at least two thousand 
years before the real Christ was born in Bethlehem of 
Jud&aelig;a; in a word, it is Buddhism; and let those who may be 
disposed to doubt this assertion, compare the Popery of Rome, and
the superstitious practices of its followers, with the doings of 
the priests who surround the grand Lama; and the mouthings, 
bellowing, turnings round, and, above all, the penances of the 
followers of Buddh with those of Roman devotees.&nbsp; But he is 
not going to dwell here on this point; it is dwelt upon at 
tolerable length in the text, and has likewise been handled with 
extraordinary power by the pen of the gifted but irreligious 
Volney; moreover, the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the Roman priesthood
are perfectly well aware that their <!-- page 307--><a 
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>system is 
nothing but Buddhism under a slight disguise, and the European 
world in general has entertained for some time past an inkling of
the fact.</p>
<p>And now a few words with respect to the motives of the writer 
for expressing a hatred for Rome.</p>
<p>This expressed abhorrence of the author for Rome might be 
entitled to little regard, provided it were possible to attribute
it to any self-interested motive.&nbsp; There have been professed
enemies of Rome, or of this or that system; but their professed 
enmity may frequently be traced to some cause which does them 
little credit; but the writer of these lines has no motive, and 
can have no motive, for his enmity to Rome, save the abhorrence 
of an honest heart for what is false, base, and cruel.&nbsp; A 
certain clergyman wrote with much heat against the Papists in the
time of . . ., who was known to favour the Papists, but was not 
expected to continue long in office, and whose supposed 
successor, the person, indeed, who did succeed him, was thought 
to be hostile to the Papists.&nbsp; This divine, who obtained a 
rich benefice from the successor of . . ., who during . . 
.&rsquo;s time had always opposed him in everything he proposed 
to do, and who, of course, during that time, affected to be very 
inimical to Popery&mdash;this divine might well be suspected of 
having a motive equally creditable for writing against the 
Papists, as that which induced him to write for them, as soon as 
his patron, who eventually did something more for him, had 
espoused their cause; but what motive, save an honest one, can 
the present writer have for expressing an abhorrence of 
Popery?&nbsp; He is no clergyman, and consequently can expect 
neither benefices nor bishoprics, supposing it were the fashion 
of the present, or likely to be the fashion of any future 
administration, to reward clergymen with benefices or bishoprics,
who, in the defence of the religion of their country, write, or 
shall write, against Popery, and not to reward those who write, 
or shall write, in favour of it and all its nonsense and 
abominations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if not a clergyman, he is the servant of a certain 
society, which has the overthrow of Popery in view, and 
therefore,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; This assertion, which has been 
frequently made, is incorrect, even as those who have made it 
probably knew it to be.&nbsp; He is the servant of no society 
whatever.&nbsp; He eats his own bread, and is one of the very few
men in England who are independent in every sense of the 
word.</p>
<p>It is true he went to Spain with the colours of that society 
on his hat&mdash;oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the marrow
awakes in his old bones when he thinks of what he accomplished in
Spain in the cause of religion and civilisation with the colours 
of that society on his hat, and its weapon in his hand, even the 
sword of the word of God; how with that weapon he hewed left and 
right, making the priests fly before him, and run away squeaking:
&ldquo;Vaya! que demonio es este!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, and when he 
thinks of the plenty of bible <!-- page 308--><a 
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>swords 
which he left behind him, destined to prove, and which have 
already proved, pretty calthrops in the heels of Popery.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Halloo!&nbsp; Batuschca,&rdquo; he exclaimed the other 
night, on reading an article in a newspaper; &ldquo;what do you 
think of the present doings in Spain?&nbsp; Your old friend the 
zingaro, the gitano who rode about Spain, to say nothing of 
Galicia, with the Greek Buchini behind him as his squire, had a 
hand in bringing them about; there are many brave Spaniards 
connected with the present movement who took bibles from his 
hands, and read them and profited by them, learning from the 
inspired page the duties of one man towards another, and the real
value of a priesthood and their head, who set at nought the word 
of God, and think only of their own temporal interests; ay, and 
who learned Gitano&mdash;their own Gitano&mdash;from the lips of 
the London Calor&oacute;, and also songs in the said Gitano, very
fit to dumbfounder your semi-Buddhist priests when they attempt 
to bewilder people&rsquo;s minds with their school-logic and 
pseudo-ecclesiastical nonsense, songs such as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Un 
Erajai<br />
Sinaba chibando un sermon . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;But with that society he has long since ceased to have 
any connection; he bade it adieu with feelings of love and 
admiration more than fourteen years ago; so, in continuing to 
assault Popery, no hopes of interest founded on that society can 
sway his mind&mdash;interest! who, with worldly interest in view,
would ever have anything to do with that society?&nbsp; It is 
poor, and supported, like its founder Christ, by poor people; and
so far from having political influence, it is in such disfavour, 
and has ever been, with the dastardly great, to whom the 
government of England has for many years past been confided, that
the having borne its colours only for a month would be sufficient
to exclude any man, whatever his talents, his learning, or his 
courage may be, from the slightest chance of being permitted to 
serve his country either for fee or without.&nbsp; A fellow who 
unites in himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or 
rather book-maker, and the laughed-down single speech spouter of 
the House of Commons, may look forward, always supposing that at 
one time he has been a foaming radical, to the government of an 
important colony.&nbsp; Ay, an ancient fox who has lost his tail 
may, provided he has a score of radical friends, who will swear 
that he can bark Chinese, though Chinese is not barked but sung, 
be forced upon a Chinese colony, though it is well known that to 
have lost one&rsquo;s tail is considered by the Chinese in 
general as an irreparable infamy, whilst to have been once 
connected with a certain society, to which, to its honour be it 
said, all the radical party are vehemently hostile, would be 
quite sufficient to keep any one not only from a government, but 
something much less, even though he could translate the rhymed 
&ldquo;Sessions of Hariri,&rdquo; and <!-- page 309--><a 
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>were 
versed, still retaining his tail, in the two languages in which 
Kien-Loung wrote his Eulogium on Moukden, that piece which, 
translated by Amyot, the learned Jesuit, won the applause of the 
celebrated Voltaire.</p>
<p>No! were the author influenced by hopes of fee or reward, he 
would, instead of writing against Popery, write for it; all the 
trumpery titled&mdash;he will not call them great 
again&mdash;would then be for him, and their masters the 
radicals, with their hosts of newspapers, would be for him, more 
especially if he would commence maligning the society whose 
colours he had once on his hat&mdash;a society which, as the 
priest says in the text, is one of the very few Protestant 
institutions for which the Popish Church entertains any fear, and
consequently respect, as it respects nothing which it does not 
fear.&nbsp; The writer said that certain &ldquo;rulers&rdquo; 
would never forgive him for having been connected with that 
society; he went perhaps too far in saying 
&ldquo;never.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that they would take 
him into favour on one condition, which is, that he should turn 
his pen and his voice against that society; such a mark &ldquo;of
a better way of thinking&rdquo; would perhaps induce them to give
him a government, nearly as good as that which they gave to a 
certain ancient radical fox at the intercession of his radical 
friends (who were bound to keep him from the pauper&rsquo;s 
kennel), after he had promised to foam, bark, and snarl at 
corruption no more; he might even entertain hopes of succeeding, 
nay of superseding, the ancient creature in his government; but 
even were he as badly off as he is well off he would do no such 
thing.&nbsp; He would rather exist on crusts and water; he has 
often done so and been happy; nay, he would rather starve than be
a rogue&mdash;for even the feeling of starvation is happiness 
compared with what he feels who knows himself to be a rogue, 
provided he has any feeling at all.&nbsp; What is the use of a 
mitre or a knighthood to a man who has betrayed his 
principles?&nbsp; What is the use of a gilt collar, nay, even of 
a pair of scarlet breeches, to a fox who has lost his tail?&nbsp;
Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of the fox who has lost his 
tail; and with reason, for his very mate loathes him, and more 
especially if, like himself, she has lost her brush.&nbsp; Oh! 
the horror which haunts the mind of the two-legged rogue who has 
parted with his principles, or those which he professed&mdash;for
what?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll suppose a government.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s 
the use of a government, if, the next day after you have received
it, you are obliged for very shame to scurry off to it with the 
hoot of every honest man sounding in your ears?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lightly liar leaped and away ran.&rdquo;<br
/>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Piers Plowman</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But bigotry, it has been said, makes the author write against 
Popery; and thorough-going bigotry, indeed, will make a person 
say or do anything.&nbsp; But the writer is a very pretty bigot 
truly!&nbsp; <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>Where will the public find traces of
bigotry in anything he has written?&nbsp; He has written against 
Rome with all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, 
and with all his strength; but as a person may be quite honest 
and speak and write against Rome in like manner he may speak and 
write against her and be quite free from bigotry; though it is 
impossible for any one but a bigot or a bad man to write or speak
in her praise; her doctrines, actions, and machinations being 
what they are.</p>
<p>Bigotry!&nbsp; The author was born, and has always continued, 
in the wrong church for bigotry, the quiet, unpretending Church 
of England; a church which, had it been a bigoted church, and not
long-suffering almost to a fault, might with its opportunities, 
as the priest says in the text, have stood in a very different 
position from that which it occupies at present.&nbsp; No! let 
those who are in search of bigotry seek for it in a church very 
different from the inoffensive Church of England, which never 
encourages cruelty or calumny.&nbsp; Let them seek for it amongst
the members of the Church of Rome, and more especially amongst 
those who have renegaded to it.&nbsp; There is nothing, however 
false and horrible, which a pervert to Rome will not say for his 
church, and which his priests will not encourage him in saying; 
and there is nothing, however horrible&mdash;the more horrible 
indeed and revolting to human nature, the more eager he would be 
to do it&mdash;which he will not do for it, and which his priests
will not encourage him in doing.</p>
<p>Of the readiness which converts to Popery exhibit to sacrifice
all the ties of blood and affection on the shrine of their 
newly-adopted religion there is a curious illustration in the 
work of Luigi Pulci.&nbsp; This man, who was born at Florence in 
the year 1432, and who was deeply versed in the Bible, composed a
poem, called the &ldquo;Morgante Maggiore,&rdquo; which he 
recited at the table of Lorenzo de Medici, the great patron of 
Italian genius.&nbsp; It is a mock-heroic and religious poem, in 
which the legends of knight-errantry, and of the Popish Church, 
are turned to unbounded ridicule.&nbsp; The pretended hero of it 
is a converted giant, called Morgante; though his adventures do 
not occupy the twentieth part of the poem, the principal 
personages being Charlemagne, Orlando, and his cousin Rinaldo of 
Montalban.&nbsp; Morgante has two brothers, both of them giants, 
and, in the first canto of the poem, Morgante is represented with
his brothers as carrying on a feud with the abbot and monks of a 
certain convent, built upon the confines of heathenesse; the 
giants being in the habit of flinging down stones, or rather huge
rocks, on the convent.&nbsp; Orlando, however, who is banished 
from the court of Charlemagne, arriving at the convent, 
undertakes to destroy them, and accordingly kills Passamonte and 
Alabastro, and converts Morgante, whose mind has been previously 
softened by a vision, in which the &ldquo;Blessed Virgin&rdquo; 
figures.&nbsp; No sooner is he converted than, as a sign of his 
penitence, what does he do, but hastens and cuts off the hands of
his two brothers, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>&ldquo;Io vo&rsquo; tagliar le mani 
a tutti quanti<br />
E porterolle a que&rsquo; monaci santi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he does cut off the hands of his brethren, and carries 
them to the abbot, who blesses him for so doing.&nbsp; Pulci here
is holding up to ridicule and execration the horrid butchery or 
betrayal of friends by Popish converts, and the encouragement 
they receive from the priest.&nbsp; No sooner is a person 
converted to Popery than his principal thought is how he can 
bring the hands and feet of his brethren, however harmless they 
may be, and different from the giants, to the &ldquo;holy 
priests,&rdquo; who, if he manages to do so, never fail to praise
him, saying to the miserable wretch, as the abbot said to 
Morgante:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tu sarai or perfetto e vero amico<br />
A Cristo, quanto tu gli eri nemico.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can the English public deny the justice of Pulci&rsquo;s 
illustration, after something which it has lately witnessed? <a 
name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311" 
class="citation">[311]</a>&nbsp; Has it not seen equivalents for 
the hands and feet of brothers carried by Popish perverts to the 
&ldquo;holy priests,&rdquo; and has it not seen the manner in 
which the offering has been received?&nbsp; Let those who are in 
quest of bigotry seek for it amongst the perverts to Rome, and 
not amongst those who, born in the pale of the Church of England,
have always continued in it.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; ON FOREIGN NONSENSE.</h3>
<p>With respect to the third point, various lessons which the 
book reads to the nation at large, and which it would be well for
the nation to ponder and profit by.</p>
<p>There are many species of nonsense to which the nation is much
addicted, and of which the perusal of Lavengro ought to give them
a wholesome shame.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to the 
foreign nonsense so prevalent now in England.&nbsp; The hero is a
scholar; but, though possessed of a great many tongues, he 
affects to be neither Frenchman nor German, nor this or that 
foreigner; he is one who loves his country, and the language and 
literature of his country, and speaks up for each and all when 
there is occasion to do so.&nbsp; Now what is the case with nine 
out of ten amongst those of the English who study foreign 
languages?&nbsp; No sooner have they picked up a smattering of 
this or that speech than they begin to abuse their own country 
and everything connected with it, more <!-- page 312--><a 
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>especially 
its language.&nbsp; This is particularly the case with those who 
call themselves German students.&nbsp; It is said, and the writer
believes with truth, that when a woman falls in love with a 
particularly ugly fellow, she squeezes him with ten times more 
zest than she would a handsome one if captivated by him.&nbsp; So
it is with these German students; no sooner have they taken 
German in hand than there is nothing like German.&nbsp; Oh, the 
dear, delightful German!&nbsp; How proud am I that it is now my 
own, and that its divine literature is within my reach!&nbsp; And
all this whilst mumbling the most uncouth speech, and crunching 
the most crabbed literature in Europe.&nbsp; The writer is not an
exclusive admirer of everything English; he does not advise his 
country-people never to go abroad, never to study foreign 
languages, and he does not wish to persuade them that there is 
nothing beautiful or valuable in foreign literature; he only 
wishes that they would not make themselves fools with respect to 
foreign people, foreign languages or reading; that if they chance
to have been in Spain, and have picked up a little Spanish, they 
would not affect the airs of Spaniards; that if males they would 
not make Tom-fools of themselves by sticking cigars into their 
mouths, dressing themselves in zamarras, and saying, carajo! <a 
name="citation312"></a><a href="#footnote312" 
class="citation">[312]</a> and if females that they would not 
make zanies of themselves by sticking cigars into their mouths, 
flinging mantillas over their heads, and by saying carai, and 
perhaps carajo too; or if they have been in France or Italy, and 
have picked up a little French or Italian, they would not affect 
to be French or Italians; and particularly, after having been a 
month or two in Germany, or picked up a little German in England,
they would not make themselves foolish about everything German, 
as the Anglo-German in the book does&mdash;a real character, the 
founder of the Anglo-German school in England, and the cleverest 
Englishman who ever talked or wrote encomiastic nonsense about 
Germany and the Germans.&nbsp; Of all infatuations connected with
what is foreign, the infatuation about everything that is German,
to a certain extent prevalent in England, is assuredly the most 
ridiculous.&nbsp; One can find something like a palliation for 
people making themselves somewhat foolish about particular 
languages, literatures, and people.&nbsp; The Spanish certainly 
is a noble language, and there is something wild and captivating 
in the Spanish character, and its literature contains the grand 
book of the world.&nbsp; French is a manly language.&nbsp; The 
French are the most martial people in the world; and French 
literature is admirable in many respects.&nbsp; Italian is a 
sweet language, and of beautiful simplicity&mdash;its literature 
perhaps the first in the world.&nbsp; The 
Italians!&mdash;wonderful men have sprung up in Italy.&nbsp; 
Italy is not merely famous for painters, poets, musicians, 
singers, and linguists&mdash;the greatest linguist the world ever
saw, the late Cardinal Mezzofanti, was an Italian; but it is 
celebrated <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>for men&mdash;men emphatically 
speaking: Columbus was an Italian, Alexander Farnese was an 
Italian, so was the mightiest of the mighty, Napoleon 
Bonaparte;&mdash;but the German language, German literature, and 
the Germans!&nbsp; The writer has already stated his opinion with
respect to German; he does not speak from ignorance or prejudice;
he has heard German spoken, and many other languages.&nbsp; 
German literature! he does not speak from ignorance; he has read 
that and many a literature, and he repeats . . . however, he 
acknowledges that there is one fine poem in the German language, 
that poem is the &ldquo;Oberon&rdquo;; a poem, by-the-bye, 
ignored by the Germans&mdash;a speaking fact&mdash;and of course 
by the Anglo-Germanists.&nbsp; The Germans! he has been amongst 
them, and amongst many other nations, and confesses that his 
opinion of the Germans, as men, is a very low one.&nbsp; Germany,
it is true, has produced one very great man, the monk who fought 
the pope, and nearly knocked him down; but this man his 
countrymen&mdash;a telling fact&mdash;affect to despise, and of 
course the Anglo-Germanists: the father of Anglo-Germanism was 
very fond of inveighing against Luther.</p>
<p>The madness, or rather foolery, of the English for foreign 
customs, dresses, and languages, is not an affair of to-day or 
yesterday&mdash;it is of very ancient date, and was very properly
exposed nearly three centuries ago by one Andrew Borde, who, 
under the picture of a &ldquo;Naked man with a pair of shears in 
one hand, and a roll of cloth in the other,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313" 
class="citation">[313]</a> inserted the following lines along 
with others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am an Englishman, and naked I stand 
here,<br />
Musing in my mind what garment I shall weare;<br />
For now I will weare this, and now I will weare that,<br />
Now I will weare, I cannot tell what.<br />
All new fashions be pleasant to mee,<br />
I will have them, whether I thrive or thee;<br />
What do I care if all the world me fail?<br />
I will have a garment reach to my taile;<br />
Then am I a minion, for I weare the new guise.<br />
The next yeare after I hope to be wise,<br />
Not only in wearing my gorgeous array,<br />
For I will go to learning a whole summer&rsquo;s day;<br />
I will learn Latine, Hebrew, Greek, and French,<br />
And I will learn Dutch, sitting on my bench.<br />
I had no peere if to myself I were true,<br />
Because I am not so, divers times do I rue.<br />
Yet I lacke nothing, I have all things at will<br />
If I were wise and would hold myself still,<br />
And meddle with no matters but to me pertaining,<br />
But ever to be true to God and my king.<br />
But I have such matters rowling in my pate,<br />
That I will and do . . . I cannot tell what,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<h3><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; ON GENTILITY 
NONSENSE&mdash;ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENTILITY.</h3>
<p>What is gentility?&nbsp; People in different stations in 
England entertain different ideas of what is genteel, <a 
name="citation314"></a><a href="#footnote314" 
class="citation">[314]</a> but it must be something gorgeous, 
glittering, or tawdry, to be considered genteel by any of 
them.&nbsp; The beau-ideal of the English aristocracy, of course 
with some exceptions, is some young fellow with an imperial 
title, a military personage of course, for what is military is so
particularly genteel, with flaming epaulets, a cocked hat and a 
plume, a prancing charger, and a band of fellows called generals 
and colonels, with flaming epaulets, cocked hats and plumes, and 
prancing chargers, vapouring behind him.&nbsp; It was but lately 
that the daughter of an English marquis was heard to say, that 
the sole remaining wish of her heart&mdash;she had known 
misfortunes, and was not far from fifty&mdash;was to be 
introduced to&mdash;whom?&nbsp; The Emperor of Austria!&nbsp; The
sole remaining wish of the heart of one who ought to have been 
thinking of the grave and judgment, was to be introduced to the 
miscreant who had caused the blood of noble Hungarian females to 
be whipped out of their shoulders, for no other crime than 
devotion to their country, and its tall and heroic sons.&nbsp; 
The middle classes&mdash;of course there are some 
exceptions&mdash;admire the aristocracy, and consider them pinks,
the aristocracy who admire the Emperor of Austria, and adored the
Emperor of Russia, till he became old, ugly, and unfortunate, 
when their adoration instantly <!-- page 315--><a 
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>terminated;
for what is more ungenteel than age, ugliness, and 
misfortune!&nbsp; The beau-ideal with those of the lower classes,
with peasants and mechanics, is some flourishing railroad 
contractor: look, for example, how they worship Mr. 
Flamson.&nbsp; This person makes his grand 
<i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i> in the year thirty-nine, at a public 
meeting in the principal room of a country inn.&nbsp; He has come
into the neighbourhood with the character of a man worth a 
million pounds, who is to make everybody&rsquo;s fortune; at this
time, however, he is not worth a shilling of his own, though he 
flashes about dexterously three or four thousand pounds, part of 
which sum he has obtained by specious pretences, and part from 
certain individuals who are his confederates.&nbsp; But in the 
year forty-nine, he is really in possession of the fortune which 
he and his agents pretended he was worth ten years 
before&mdash;he is worth a million pounds.&nbsp; By what means 
has he come by them?&nbsp; By railroad contracts, for which he 
takes care to be paid in hard cash before he attempts to perform 
them, and to carry out which he makes use of the sweat and blood 
of wretches who, since their organisation, have introduced crimes
and language into England to which it was previously almost a 
stranger&mdash;by purchasing, with paper, shares by hundreds in 
the schemes to execute which he contracts, and which are of his 
own devising; which shares he sells as soon as they are at a high
premium, to which they are speedily forced by means of 
paragraphs, inserted by himself and agents, in newspapers devoted
to his interest, utterly reckless of the terrible depreciation to
which they are almost instantly subjected.&nbsp; But he is worth 
a million pounds, there can be no doubt of the fact&mdash;he has 
not made people&rsquo;s fortunes, at least those whose fortunes 
it was said he would make; he has made them away: but his own he 
has made, emphatically made it; he is worth a million 
pounds.&nbsp; Hurrah for the millionaire!&nbsp; The clown who 
views the pandemonium of red brick which he has built on the 
estate which he has purchased in the neighbourhood of the place 
of his grand <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i>, in which every species of
architecture, Greek, Indian, and Chinese, is employed in 
caricature&mdash;who hears of the grand entertainment he gives at
Christmas in the principal dining-room, the hundred wax-candles, 
the waggon-load of plate, and the oceans of wine which form parts
of it, and above all the two ostrich poults, one at the head, and
the other at the foot of the table, exclaims, &ldquo;Well! if he 
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bang up, I don&rsquo;t know who be; why, he 
beats my lord hollow!&rdquo;&nbsp; The mechanic of the borough 
town, who sees him dashing through the streets in an open landau,
drawn by four milk-white horses, amidst its attendant outriders; 
his wife, a monster of a woman, by his side, stout as the wife of
Tamerlane, who weighed twenty stone, and bedizened out like her 
whose person shone with the jewels of plundered Persia, stares 
with silent wonder, and at last exclaims, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
man for my vote!&rdquo;&nbsp; You tell the clown that the man of 
the mansion has contributed enormously to corrupt the rural 
innocence of <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>England; you point to an incipient 
branch railroad, from around which the accents of Gomorrah are 
sounding, and beg him to listen for a moment, and then close his 
ears.&nbsp; Hodge scratches his head and says, &ldquo;Well, I 
have nothing to say to that; all I know is, that he is bang up, 
and I wish I were he;&rdquo; perhaps he will add&mdash;a Hodge 
has been known to add&mdash;&ldquo;He has been kind enough to put
my son on that very railroad; &rsquo;tis true the company is 
somewhat queer and the work rather killing, but he gets there 
half-a-crown a day, whereas from the farmers he would only get 
eighteen-pence.&rdquo;&nbsp; You remind the mechanic that the man
in the landau has been the ruin of thousands, and you mention 
people whom he himself knows, people in various grades of life, 
widows and orphans amongst them, whose little all he has 
dissipated, and whom he has reduced to beggary by inducing them 
to become sharers in his delusive schemes.&nbsp; But the mechanic
says, &ldquo;Well, the more fools they to let themselves be 
robbed.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t call that kind of thing robbery, 
I merely call it outwitting; and everybody in this free country 
has a right to outwit others if he can.&nbsp; What a turn-out he 
has!&rdquo;&nbsp; One was once heard to add, &ldquo;I never saw a
more genteel-looking man in all my life except one, and that was 
a gentleman&rsquo;s walley, who was much like him.&nbsp; It is 
true he is rather undersized, but then madam, you know, makes up 
for all.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; SUBJECT OF GENTILITY CONTINUED.</h3>
<p>In the last chapter have been exhibited specimens of 
gentility, so considered by different classes; by one class, 
power, youth, and epaulets are considered the <i>ne plus 
ultra</i> of gentility; by another class, pride, stateliness, and
title; by another, wealth and flaming tawdriness.&nbsp; But what 
constitutes a gentleman?&nbsp; It is easy to say at once what 
constitutes a gentleman, and there are no distinctions in what is
gentlemanly, <a name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316" 
class="citation">[316]</a> as there are in what is genteel.&nbsp;
The characteristics of a gentleman are high feeling&mdash;a 
determination never to take a cowardly advantage of 
another&mdash;a liberal education&mdash;absence of narrow 
views&mdash;generosity and courage, propriety of behaviour.&nbsp;
Now a person may be genteel according to one or another of the 
three standards described above, and <!-- page 317--><a 
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>not possess
one of the characteristics of a gentleman.&nbsp; Is the emperor a
gentleman, with spatters of blood on his clothes, scourged from 
the backs of noble Hungarian women?&nbsp; Are the aristocracy 
gentlefolks, who admire him?&nbsp; Is Mr. Flamson a gentleman, 
although he has a million pounds?&nbsp; No! cowardly miscreants, 
admirers of cowardly miscreants, and people who make a million 
pounds by means compared with which those employed to make 
fortunes by the getters up of the South Sea Bubble might be 
called honest dealing, are decidedly not gentlefolks.&nbsp; Now 
as it is clearly demonstrable that a person may be perfectly 
genteel according to some standard or other, and yet be no 
gentleman, so is it demonstrable that a person may have no 
pretensions to gentility, and yet be a gentleman.&nbsp; For 
example, there is Lavengro!&nbsp; Would the admirers of the 
emperor, or the admirers of those who admire the emperor, or the 
admirers of Mr. Flamson, call him genteel? and gentility with 
them is everything!&nbsp; Assuredly they would not; and assuredly
they would consider him respectively as a being to be shunned, 
despised, or hooted.&nbsp; Genteel!&nbsp; Why, at one time he is 
a hack author&mdash;writes reviewals for eighteen-pence a 
page&mdash;edits a Newgate chronicle.&nbsp; At another he wanders
the country with a face grimy from occasionally mending kettles; 
and there is no evidence that his clothes are not seedy and torn,
and his shoes down at the heel; but by what process of reasoning 
will they prove that he is no gentleman?&nbsp; Is he not 
learned?&nbsp; Has he not generosity and courage?&nbsp; Whilst a 
hack author, does he pawn the books entrusted to him to 
review?&nbsp; Does he break his word to his publisher?&nbsp; Does
he write begging letters?&nbsp; Does he get clothes or lodgings 
without paying for them?&nbsp; Again, whilst a wanderer, does he 
insult helpless women on the road with loose proposals or ribald 
discourse?&nbsp; Does he take what is not his own from the 
hedges?&nbsp; Does he play on the fiddle, or make faces in 
public-houses, in order to obtain pence or beer? or does he call 
for liquor, swallow it, and then say to a widowed landlady, 
&ldquo;Mistress, I have no brass&rdquo;?&nbsp; In a word, what 
vice and crime does he perpetrate&mdash;what low acts does he 
commit?&nbsp; Therefore, with his endowments, who will venture to
say that he is no gentleman?&mdash;unless it be an admirer of Mr.
Flamson&mdash;a clown&mdash;who will, perhaps, 
shout&mdash;&ldquo;I say he is no gentleman; for who can be a 
gentleman who keeps no gig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indifference exhibited by Lavengro for what is merely 
genteel, compared with his solicitude never to infringe the 
strict laws of honour, should read a salutary lesson.&nbsp; The 
generality of his countrymen are far more careful not to 
transgress the customs of what they call gentility, than to 
violate the laws of honour or morality.&nbsp; They will shrink 
from carrying their own carpet-bag, and from speaking to a person
in seedy raiment, whilst to matters of much higher importance 
they are shamelessly indifferent.&nbsp; Not so Lavengro; he will 
do anything that he deems convenient, or <!-- page 318--><a 
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>which 
strikes his fancy, provided it does not outrage decency or is 
unallied to profligacy; is not ashamed to speak to a beggar in 
rags, and will associate with anybody, provided he can gratify a 
laudable curiosity.&nbsp; He has no abstract love for what is 
low, or what the world calls low.&nbsp; He sees that many things 
which the world looks down upon are valuable, so he prizes much 
which the world contemns; he sees that many things which the 
world admires are contemptible, so he despises much which the 
world does not; but when the world prizes what is really 
excellent, he does not contemn it, because the world regards 
it.&nbsp; If he learns Irish, which all the world scoffs at, he 
likewise learns Italian, which all the world melts at.&nbsp; If 
he learns Gypsy, the language of the tattered tent, he likewise 
learns Greek, the language of the college hall.&nbsp; If he 
learns smithery, he also learns . . . ah! what does he learn to 
set against smithery?&mdash;the law?&nbsp; No; he does not learn 
the law, which, by the way, is not very genteel.&nbsp; 
Swimming?&nbsp; Yes, he learns to swim.&nbsp; Swimming, however, 
is not genteel; and the world&mdash;at least the genteel part of 
it&mdash;acts very wisely in setting its face against it; for to 
swim you must be naked, and how would many a genteel person look 
without his clothes?&nbsp; Come! he learns horsemanship; a very 
genteel accomplishment, which every genteel person would gladly 
possess, though not all genteel people do.</p>
<p>Again as to associates: if he holds communion when a boy with 
Murtagh, the scarecrow of an Irish academy, he associates in 
after life with Francis Ardry, a rich and talented young Irish 
gentleman about town.&nbsp; If he accepts an invitation from Mr. 
Petulengro to his tent, he has no objection to go home with a 
rich genius to dinner; who then will say that he prizes a thing 
or a person because they are ungenteel?&nbsp; That he is not 
ready to take up with everything that is ungenteel he gives a 
proof, when he refuses, though on the brink of starvation, to 
become bonnet to the thimble-man, an office which, though 
profitable, is positively ungenteel.&nbsp; Ah! but some 
sticker-up for gentility will exclaim, &ldquo;The hero did not 
refuse this office from an insurmountable dislike to its 
ungentility, but merely from a feeling of principle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well! the writer is not fond of argument, and he will admit that 
such was the case; he admits that it was a love of principle, 
rather than an over-regard for gentility, which prevented the 
hero from accepting, when on the brink of starvation, an 
ungenteel though lucrative office, an office which, the writer 
begs leave to observe, many a person with a great regard for 
gentility, and no particular regard for principle, would in a 
similar strait have accepted; for when did a mere love for 
gentility keep a person from being a dirty scoundrel, when the 
alternatives apparently were &ldquo;either to be a dirty 
scoundrel or starve&rdquo;?&nbsp; One thing, however, is certain,
which is, that Lavengro did not accept the office, which if a 
love for what is low had been his ruling passion he certainly 
would have done; consequently, he refuses to do one thing which 
no genteel person would willingly do, even as <!-- page 319--><a 
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>he does 
many things which every genteel person would gladly do, for 
example speaks Italian, rides on horseback, associates with a 
fashionable young man, dines with a rich genius, et cetera.&nbsp;
Yet&mdash;and it cannot be minced&mdash;he and gentility with 
regard to many things are at strange divergency; he shrinks from 
many things at which gentility placidly hums a tune, or 
approvingly simpers, and does some things at which gentility 
positively sinks.&nbsp; He will not run into debt for clothes or 
lodgings, which he might do without any scandal to gentility; he 
will not receive money from Francis Ardry, and go to Brighton 
with the sister of Annette Le Noir, though there is nothing 
ungenteel in borrowing money from a friend, even when you never 
intend to repay him, and something poignantly genteel in going to
a watering-place with a gay young Frenchwoman; but he has no 
objection, after raising twenty pounds by the sale of that 
extraordinary work &ldquo;Joseph Sell,&rdquo; to set off into the
country, mend kettles under hedge-rows, and make pony and donkey 
shoes in a dingle.&nbsp; Here, perhaps, some plain, well-meaning 
person will cry&mdash;and with much apparent justice&mdash;how 
can the writer justify him in this act?&nbsp; What motive, save a
love for what is low, could induce him to do such things?&nbsp; 
Would the writer have everybody who is in need of recreation go 
into the country, mend kettles under hedges, and make pony shoes 
in dingles?&nbsp; To such an observation the writer would answer,
that Lavengro had an excellent motive in doing what he did, but 
that the writer is not so unreasonable as to wish everybody to do
the same.&nbsp; It is not everybody who can mend kettles.&nbsp; 
It is not everybody who is in similar circumstances to those in 
which Lavengro was.&nbsp; Lavengro flies from London and hack 
authorship, and takes to the roads from fear of consumption; it 
is expensive to put up at inns, and even at public-houses, and 
Lavengro has not much money; so he buys a tinker&rsquo;s cart and
apparatus, and sets up as tinker, and subsequently as blacksmith;
a person living in a tent, or in anything else, must do something
or go mad; Lavengro had a mind, as he himself well knew, with 
some slight tendency to madness, and had he not employed himself,
he must have gone wild; so to employ himself he drew upon one of 
his resources, the only one available at the time.&nbsp; 
Authorship had nearly killed him, he was sick of reading, and had
besides no books; but he possessed the rudiments of an art akin 
to tinkering; he knew something of smithery, having served a kind
of apprenticeship in Ireland to a fairy smith; so he draws upon 
his smithery to enable him to acquire tinkering, and through the 
help which it affords him, owing to its connection with 
tinkering, he speedily acquires that craft, even as he had 
speedily acquired Welsh, owing to its connection with Irish, 
which language he possessed; and with tinkering he amuses himself
until he lays it aside to resume smithery.&nbsp; A man who has 
any innocent resource, has quite as much right to draw upon it in
need, as he has, upon a banker in whose hands he has placed a 
sum; Lavengro turns to advantage, <!-- page 320--><a 
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>under 
particular circumstances, a certain resource which he has but 
people who are not so forlorn as Lavengro, and have not served 
the same apprenticeship which he had, are not advised to follow 
his example.&nbsp; Surely he was better employed in plying the 
trades of tinker and smith than in having recourse to vice, in 
running after milk-maids for example.&nbsp; Running after 
milk-maids is by no means an ungenteel rural diversion; but let 
any one ask some respectable casuist (the Bishop of London for 
example), whether Lavengro was not far better employed, when in 
the country, at tinkering and smithery than he would have been in
running after all the milkmaids in Cheshire, though tinkering is 
in general considered a very ungenteel employment, and smithery 
little better, notwithstanding that an Orcadian poet, who wrote 
in Norse about eight hundred years ago, reckons the latter 
amongst nine noble arts which he possessed, naming it along with 
playing at chess, on the harp, and ravelling runes, or as the 
original has it, &ldquo;treading runes&rdquo;&mdash;that is, 
compressing them into a small compass by mingling one letter with
another, even as the Turkish caligraphists ravel the Arabic 
letters, more especially those who write talismans.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nine arts have I, all noble;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I play at chess so free,<br />
At ravelling runes I&rsquo;m ready,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At books and smithery;<br />
I&rsquo;m skill&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er ice at skimming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On skates, I shoot and row,<br />
And few at harping match me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or minstrelsy, I trow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But though Lavengro takes up smithery, which, though the 
Orcadian ranks it with chess-playing and harping, is certainly 
somewhat of a grimy art, there can be no doubt that, had he been 
wealthy and not so forlorn as he was, he would have turned to 
many things, honourable, of course, in preference.&nbsp; He has 
no objection to ride a fine horse when he has the opportunity: he
has his day-dream of making a fortune of two hundred thousand 
pounds by becoming a merchant and doing business after the 
Armenian fashion; and there can be no doubt that he would have 
been glad to wear fine clothes, provided he had had sufficient 
funds to authorise him in wearing them.&nbsp; For the sake of 
wandering the country and plying the hammer and tongs he would 
not have refused a commission in the service of that illustrious 
monarch George the Fourth, provided he had thought that he could 
live on his pay, and not be forced to run in debt to tradesmen, 
without any hope of paying them, for clothes and luxuries, as 
many highly genteel officers in that honourable service were in 
the habit of doing.&nbsp; For the sake of tinkering he would 
certainly not have refused a secretaryship of an embassy to 
Persia, in which he might have turned his acquaintance with 
Persian, Arabic, and the Lord only knows what other languages, to
<!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
321</span>account.&nbsp; He took to tinkering and smithery, 
because no better employments were at his command.&nbsp; No war 
is waged in the book against rank, wealth, fine clothes, or 
dignified employments; it is shown, however, that a person may be
a gentleman and a scholar without them.&nbsp; Rank, wealth, fine 
clothes, and dignified employments are no doubt very fine things,
but they are merely externals, they do not make a gentleman, they
add external grace and dignity to the gentleman and scholar, but 
they make neither; and is it not better to be a gentleman without
them than not a gentleman with them?&nbsp; Is not Lavengro, when 
he leaves London on foot with twenty pounds in his pocket, 
entitled to more respect than Mr. Flamson flaming in his coach 
with a million?&nbsp; And is not even the honest jockey at 
Horncastle, who offers a fair price to Lavengro for his horse, 
entitled to more than the scoundrel lord, who attempts to cheat 
him of one-fourth of its value?</p>
<p>Millions, however, seem to think otherwise, by their servile 
adoration of people whom without rank, wealth, and fine clothes 
they would consider infamous, but whom possessed of rank, wealth,
and glittering habiliments they seem to admire all the more for 
their profligacy and crimes.&nbsp; Does not a blood-spot, or a 
lust-spot, on the clothes of a blooming emperor, give a kind of 
zest to the genteel young god?&nbsp; Do not the pride, 
superciliousness, and selfishness of a certain aristocracy make 
it all the more regarded by its worshippers? and do not the 
clownish and gutter-blood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all 
the more because they are conscious that he is a knave?&nbsp; If 
such is the case&mdash;and alas! is it not the case?&mdash;they 
cannot be too frequently told that fine clothes, wealth, and 
titles adorn a person in proportion as he adorns them; that if 
worn by the magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but 
if by the vile and profligate they are merely <i>san benitos</i>,
and only serve to make their infamy doubly apparent; and that a 
person in seedy raiment and tattered hat, possessed of courage, 
kindness, and virtue, is entitled to more respect from those to 
whom his virtues are manifested than any cruel, profligate 
emperor, selfish aristocrat, or knavish millionaire in the 
world.</p>
<p>The writer has no intention of saying that all in England are 
affected with the absurd mania for gentility; nor is such a 
statement made in the book; it is shown therein that individuals 
of various classes can prize a gentleman, notwithstanding seedy 
raiment, dusty shoes, or tattered hat,&mdash;for example, the 
young Irishman, the rich genius, the postillion, and his 
employer.&nbsp; Again, when the life of the hero is given to the 
world, amidst the howl about its lowness and vulgarity, raised by
the servile crew whom its independence of sentiment has stung, 
more than one powerful voice has been heard testifying 
approbation of its learning and the purity of its morality.&nbsp;
That there is some salt in England, minds not swayed by mere 
externals, he is fully convinced; if he were not, he would spare 
himself the trouble of writing; but to the fact that the <!-- 
page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
322</span>generality of his countrymen are basely grovelling 
before the shrine of what they are pleased to call gentility, he 
cannot shut his eyes.</p>
<p>Oh! what a clever person that Cockney was, who, travelling in 
the Aberdeen railroad carriage, after edifying the company with 
his remarks on various subjects, gave it as his opinion that 
Lieutenant P . . . would, in future, be shunned by all 
respectable society!&nbsp; And what a simple person that elderly 
gentleman was, who, abruptly starting, asked, in rather an 
authoritative voice, &ldquo;And why should Lieutenant P . . . be 
shunned by respectable society?&rdquo; and who after entering 
into what was said to be a masterly analysis of the entire 
evidence of the case, concluded by stating, &ldquo;that having 
been accustomed to all kinds of evidence all his life, he had 
never known a case in which the accused had obtained a more 
complete and triumphant justification than Lieutenant P . . . had
done in the late trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Cockney, who is said to have been a very foppish 
Cockney, was perfectly right in what he said, and therein 
manifested a knowledge of the English mind and character, and 
likewise of the modern English language, to which his catechist, 
who, it seems, was a distinguished member of the Scottish bar, 
could lay no pretensions.&nbsp; The Cockney knew what the Lord of
Session knew not, that the British public is gentility crazy, and
he knew, moreover, that gentility and respectability are 
synonymous.&nbsp; No one in England is genteel or respectable 
that is &ldquo;looked at,&rdquo; who is the victim of oppression;
he may be pitied for a time, but when did not pity terminate in 
contempt?&nbsp; A poor, harmless young officer&mdash;but why 
enter into the details of the infamous case? they are but too 
well known, and if ever cruelty, pride, and cowardice, and things
much worse than even cruelty, cowardice, and pride, were brought 
to light, and at the same time countenanced, they were in that 
case.&nbsp; What availed the triumphant justification of the poor
victim?&nbsp; There was at first a roar of indignation against 
his oppressors, but how long did it last?&nbsp; He had been 
turned out of the service, they remained in it with their red 
coats and epaulets; he was merely the son of a man who had 
rendered good service to his country, they were, for the most 
part, highly connected&mdash;they were in the extremest degree 
genteel, he quite the reverse; so the nation wavered, considered,
thought the genteel side was the safest after all, and then with 
the cry of, &ldquo;Oh! there is nothing like gentility,&rdquo; 
ratted bodily.&nbsp; Newspaper and public turned against the 
victim, scouted him, apologised for the&mdash;what should they be
called?&mdash;who were not only admitted into the most 
respectable society, but courted to come, the spots not merely of
wine on their military clothes giving them a kind of 
poignancy.&nbsp; But there is a God in heaven; the British 
glories are tarnished&mdash;Providence has never smiled on 
British arms since that case&mdash;oh! Balaklava! thy name 
interpreted is net of fishes, and well dost thou deserve that 
name.&nbsp; How many a scarlet golden fish has of late perished 
in the <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>mud amidst thee, cursing the genteel
service, and the genteel leader which brought him to such a 
doom.</p>
<p>Whether the rage for gentility is most prevalent amongst the 
upper, middle, or lower classes it is difficult to say; the 
priest in the text seems to think that it is exhibited in the 
most decided manner in the middle class; it is the writer&rsquo;s
opinion, however, that in no class is it more strongly developed 
than in the lower: what they call being well born goes a great 
way amongst them, but the possession of money much farther, 
whence Mr. Flamson&rsquo;s influence over them.&nbsp; Their rage 
against, and scorn for, any person who by his courage and talents
has advanced himself in life, and still remains poor, are 
indescribable; &ldquo;he is no better than ourselves,&rdquo; they
say, &ldquo;why should he be above us?&rdquo;&mdash;for they have
no conception that anybody has a right to ascendency over 
themselves except by birth or money.&nbsp; This feeling amongst 
the vulgar has been, to a certain extent, the bane of the two 
services, naval and military.&nbsp; The writer does not make this
assertion rashly; he observed this feeling at work in the army 
when a child, and he has good reason for believing that it was as
strongly at work in the navy at the same time, and is still as 
prevalent in both.&nbsp; Why are not brave men raised from the 
ranks? is frequently the cry; why are not brave sailors 
promoted?&nbsp; The Lord help brave soldiers and sailors who are 
promoted; they have less to undergo from the high airs of their 
brother officers, and those are hard enough to endure, than from 
the insolence of the men.&nbsp; Soldiers and sailors promoted to 
command are said to be in general tyrants; in nine cases out of 
ten, when they are tyrants, they have been obliged to have 
recourse to extreme severity in order to protect themselves from 
the insolence and mutinous spirit of the men,&mdash;&ldquo;He is 
no better than ourselves: shoot him, bayonet him, or fling him 
overboard!&rdquo; they say of some obnoxious individual raised 
above them by his merit.&nbsp; Soldiers and sailors, in general, 
will bear any amount of tyranny from a lordly sot, or the son of 
a man who has &ldquo;plenty of brass&rdquo;&mdash;their own 
term&mdash;but will mutiny against the just orders of a skilful 
and brave officer who &ldquo;is no better than 
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the affair of the 
&ldquo;Bounty,&rdquo; for example: Bligh was one of the best 
seamen that ever trod deck, and one of the bravest of men; proofs
of his seamanship he gave by steering, amidst dreadful weather, a
deeply-laden boat for nearly four thousand miles over an almost 
unknown ocean&mdash;of his bravery, at the fight of Copenhagen, 
one of the most desperate ever fought, of which after Nelson he 
was the hero: he was, moreover, not an unkind man; but the crew 
of the &ldquo;Bounty&rdquo; mutinied against him, and set him 
half naked in an open boat, with certain of his men who remained 
faithful to him, and ran away with the ship.&nbsp; Their 
principal motive for doing so was an idea, whether true or 
groundless the writer cannot say, that Bligh was &ldquo;no better
than themselves;&rdquo; he was certainly neither a lord&rsquo;s 
illegitimate, nor possessed of twenty thousand pounds.&nbsp; The 
writer <!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 324</span>knows what he is writing about, 
having been acquainted in his early years with an individual who 
was turned adrift with Bligh, and who died about the year 
&rsquo;22, a lieutenant in the navy, in a provincial town in 
which the writer was brought up.&nbsp; The ring-leaders in the 
mutiny were two scoundrels, Christian and Young, who had great 
influence with the crew, because they were genteelly 
connected.&nbsp; Bligh, after leaving the &ldquo;Bounty,&rdquo; 
had considerable difficulty in managing the men who had shared 
his fate, because they considered themselves &ldquo;as good men 
as he,&rdquo; notwithstanding that to his conduct and seamanship 
they had alone to look, under Heaven, for salvation from the 
ghastly perils that surrounded them.&nbsp; Bligh himself, in his 
journal, alludes to this feeling.&nbsp; Once, when he and his 
companions landed on a desert island, one of them said, with a 
mutinous look, that he considered himself &ldquo;as good a man as
he;&rdquo; Bligh, seizing a cutlass, called upon him to take 
another and defend himself, whereupon the man said that Bligh was
going to kill him, and made all manner of concessions; now why 
did this fellow consider himself as good a man as Bligh?&nbsp; 
Was he as good a seaman? no, nor a tenth part as good.&nbsp; As 
brave a man? no, nor a tenth part as brave; and of these facts he
was perfectly well aware, but bravery and seamanship stood for 
nothing with him, as they still stand with thousands of his 
class; Bligh was not genteel by birth or money, therefore Bligh 
was no better than himself.&nbsp; Had Bligh, before he sailed, 
got a twenty-thousand pound prize in the lottery, he would have 
experienced no insolence from this fellow, for there would have 
been no mutiny in the &ldquo;Bounty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is 
our betters,&rdquo; the crew would have said, &ldquo;and it is 
our duty to obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wonderful power of gentility in England is exemplified in 
nothing more than in what it is producing amongst Jews, Gypsies, 
and Quakers.&nbsp; It is breaking up their venerable 
communities.&nbsp; All the better, some one will say.&nbsp; Alas!
alas!&nbsp; It is making the wealthy Jews forsake the synagogue 
for the opera-house, or the gentility chapel, in which a disciple
of Mr. Platitude, in a white surplice, preaches a sermon at 
noon-day from a desk, on each side of which is a flaming 
taper.&nbsp; It is making them abandon their ancient literature, 
their &ldquo;Mischna,&rdquo; their &ldquo;Gemara,&rdquo; their 
&ldquo;Zohar,&rdquo; for gentility novels, &ldquo;The Young 
Duke,&rdquo; the most unexceptionably genteel book ever written, 
being the principal favourite.&nbsp; It makes the young Jew 
ashamed of the young Jewess, it makes her ashamed of the young 
Jew.&nbsp; The young Jew marries an opera dancer, or if the 
dancer will not have him, as is frequently the case, the cast-off
Miss of the Honourable Spencer So-and-so.&nbsp; It makes the 
young Jewess accept the honourable offer of a cashiered 
lieutenant of the Bengal Native Infantry; or if such a person 
does not come forward, the dishonourable offer of a cornet of a 
regiment of crack hussars.&nbsp; It makes poor Jews, male and 
female, forsake the synagogue for the sixpenny theatre or penny 
hop; the Jew to take up with an <!-- page 325--><a 
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>Irish 
female of loose character, and the Jewess with a musician of the 
Guards, or the Tipperary servant of Captain Mulligan.&nbsp; With 
respect to the gypsies, it is making the women what they never 
were before&mdash;harlots; and the men what they never were 
before&mdash;careless fathers and husbands.&nbsp; It has made the
daughter of Ursula the chaste take up with the base-drummer of a 
wild-beast show.&nbsp; It makes Gorgiko Brown, the gypsy man, 
leave his tent and his old wife, of an evening, and thrust 
himself into society which could well dispense with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro the other day to the 
Romany Rye, after telling him many things connected with the 
decadence of gypsyism, &ldquo;there is one Gorgiko Brown, who, 
with a face as black as a teakettle, wishes to be mistaken for a 
Christian tradesman; he goes into the parlour of a third-rate inn
of an evening, calls for rum and water, and attempts to enter 
into conversation with the company about politics and business; 
the company flout him or give him the cold shoulder, or perhaps 
complain to the landlord, who comes and asks him what business he
has in the parlour, telling him if he wants to drink to go into 
the tap-room, and perhaps collars him and kicks him out, provided
he refuses to move.&rdquo;&nbsp; With respect to the Quakers, it 
makes the young people, like the young Jews, crazy after 
gentility diversions, worship, marriages, or connections, and 
makes old Pease do what it makes Gorgiko Brown do, thrust himself
into society which could well dispense with him, and out of which
he is not kicked, because unlike the gypsy he is not poor.&nbsp; 
The writer would say much more on these points, but want of room 
prevents him; he must therefore request the reader to have 
patience until he can lay before the world a pamphlet, which he 
has been long meditating, to be entitled &ldquo;Remarks on the 
strikingly similar Effects which a Love for Gentility has 
produced, and is producing, amongst Jews, Gypsies, and 
Quakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Priest in the book has much to say on the subject of this 
gentility nonsense; no person can possibly despise it more 
thoroughly than that very remarkable individual seems to do, yet 
he hails its prevalence with pleasure, knowing the benefits which
will result from it to the church of which he is the sneering 
slave.&nbsp; &ldquo;The English are mad after gentility,&rdquo; 
says he; &ldquo;well, all the better for us; their religion for a
long time past has been a plain and simple one, and consequently 
by no means genteel; they&rsquo;ll quit it for ours, which is the
perfection of what they admire; with which Templars, Hospitalers,
mitred abbots, Gothic abbeys, long-drawn aisles, golden censers, 
incense, et cetera, are connected; nothing, or next to nothing, 
of Christ, it is true, but weighed in the balance against 
gentility, where will Christianity be? why, kicking against the 
beam&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; And in connection with the 
gentility nonsense, he expatiates largely, and with much 
contempt, on a species of literature by which the interests of 
his church in England have been very much advanced&mdash;all 
genuine priests have a thorough contempt <!-- page 326--><a 
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>for 
everything which tends to advance the interests of their 
church&mdash;this literature is made up of pseudo-Jacobitism, 
Charlie o&rsquo;er the waterism, or nonsense about Charlie 
o&rsquo;er the water.&nbsp; And the writer will now take the 
liberty of saying a few words about it on his own account.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; ON SCOTCH GENTILITY NONSENSE&mdash;CHARLIE 
O&rsquo;ER THE WATERISM.</h3>
<p>Of the literature just alluded to Scott was the 
inventor.&nbsp; It is founded on the fortunes and misfortunes of 
the Stuart family, of which Scott was the zealous defender and 
apologist, doing all that in his power lay to represent the 
members of it as noble, chivalrous, high-minded, unfortunate 
princes; though, perhaps, of all the royal families that ever 
existed upon earth, this family was the worst.&nbsp; It was 
unfortunate enough, it is true; but it owed its misfortunes 
entirely to its crimes, viciousness, bad faith, and 
cowardice.&nbsp; Nothing will be said of it here until it made 
its appearance in England to occupy the English throne.</p>
<p>The first of the family which we have to do with, James, was a
dirty, cowardly miscreant, of whom the less said the 
better.&nbsp; His son, Charles the First, was a 
tyrant&mdash;exceedingly cruel and revengeful, but weak and 
dastardly; he caused a poor fellow to be hanged in London, who 
was not his subject, because he had heard that the unfortunate 
creature had once bit his own glove at Cadiz, in Spain, at the 
mention of his name; and he permitted his own bull-dog, 
Strafford, to be executed by his own enemies, though the only 
crime of Strafford was, that he had barked furiously at those 
enemies, and had worried two or three of them, when Charles 
shouted, &ldquo;Fetch &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a bitter, 
but yet a despicable enemy, and the coldest and most worthless of
friends; for though he always hoped to be able some time or other
to hang his enemies, he was always ready to curry favour with 
them, more especially if he could do so at the expense of his 
friends.&nbsp; He was the haughtiest, yet meanest of 
mankind.&nbsp; He once caned a young nobleman for appearing 
before him in the drawing-room not dressed exactly according to 
the court etiquette; yet he condescended to flatter and 
compliment him who, from principle, was his bitterest enemy, 
namely, Harrison, when the republican colonel was conducting him 
as a prisoner to London.&nbsp; His bad faith was notorious; it 
was from abhorrence of the first public instance which he gave of
his bad faith, his breaking his word to the Infanta of Spain, 
that the poor Hiberno-Spaniard bit his glove at Cadiz; and it was
his notorious bad faith which eventually cost <!-- page 327--><a 
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>him his 
head; for the Republicans would gladly have spared him, provided 
they could have put the slightest confidence in any promise, 
however solemn, which he might have made to them.&nbsp; Of them, 
it would be difficult to say whether they most hated or despised 
him.&nbsp; Religion he had none.&nbsp; One day he favoured 
Popery; the next, on hearing certain clamours of the people, he 
sent his wife&rsquo;s domestics back packing to France, because 
they were Papists.&nbsp; Papists, however, should make him a 
saint, for he was certainly the cause of the taking of 
Rochelle.</p>
<p>His son, Charles the Second, though he passed his youth in the
school of adversity, learned no other lesson from it than the 
following one&mdash;take care of yourself, and never do an 
action, either good or bad, which is likely to bring you into any
great difficulty; and this maxim he acted up to as soon as he 
came to the throne.&nbsp; He was a Papist, but took especial care
not to acknowledge his religion, at which he frequently scoffed, 
till just before his last gasp, when he knew that he could lose 
nothing, and hoped to gain everything by it.&nbsp; He was always 
in want of money, but took care not to tax the country beyond all
endurable bounds; preferring, to such a bold and dangerous 
course, to become the secret pensioner of Louis, to whom, in 
return for his gold, he sacrificed the honour and interests of 
Britain.&nbsp; He was too lazy and sensual to delight in playing 
the part of a tyrant himself; but he never checked tyranny in 
others, save in one instance.&nbsp; He permitted beastly butchers
to commit unmentionable horrors on the feeble, unarmed, and 
disunited Covenanters of Scotland, but checked them when they 
would fain have endeavoured to play the same game on the 
numerous, united, dogged, and warlike Independents of 
England.&nbsp; To show his filial piety, he bade the hangman 
dishonour the corpses of some of his father&rsquo;s judges, 
before whom, when alive, he ran like a screaming hare; but 
permitted those who had lost their all in supporting his 
father&rsquo;s cause, to pine in misery and want.&nbsp; He would 
give to a painted harlot a thousand pounds for a loathsome 
embrace, and to a player or buffoon a hundred for a trumpery pun,
but would refuse a penny to the widow or orphan of an old 
Royalist soldier.&nbsp; He was the personification of 
selfishness; and as he loved and cared for no one, so did no one 
love or care for him.&nbsp; So little had he gained the respect 
or affection of those who surrounded him, that after his body had
undergone an after-death examination, parts of it were thrown 
down the sinks of the palace, to become eventually the prey of 
the swine and ducks of Westminster.</p>
<p>His brother, who succeeded him, James the Second, was a 
Papist, but sufficiently honest to acknowledge his Popery, but, 
upon the whole, he was a poor creature; though a tyrant, he was 
cowardly, had he not been a coward he would never have lost his 
throne.&nbsp; There were plenty of lovers of tyranny in England 
who would have stood by him, provided he would have stood by 
them, <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>and would, though not Papists, have 
encouraged him in his attempt to bring back England beneath the 
sway of Rome, and perhaps would eventually have become Papists 
themselves; but the nation raising a cry against him, and his 
son-in-law, the Prince of Orange invading the country, he forsook
his friends, of whom he had a host, but for whom he cared 
little&mdash;left his throne, for which he cared a great 
deal&mdash;and Popery in England, for which he cared yet more, to
their fate, and escaped to France, from whence, after taking a 
little heart, he repaired to Ireland, where he was speedily 
joined by a gallant army of Papists whom he basely abandoned at 
the Boyne, running away in a most lamentable condition, at the 
time when by showing a little courage he might have enabled them 
to conquer.&nbsp; This worthy, in his last will, bequeathed his 
heart to England&mdash;his right arm to Scotland&mdash;and his 
bowels to Ireland.&nbsp; What the English and Scotch said to 
their respective bequests is not known, but it is certain that an
old Irish priest, supposed to have been a great grand-uncle of 
the present Reverend Father Murtagh, on hearing of the bequest to
Ireland, fell into a great passion, and having been brought up at
&ldquo;Paris and Salamanca,&rdquo; expressed his indignation in 
the following strain:&mdash;&ldquo;Malditas sean tus tripas! 
teniamos bastante del olor de tus tripas al tiempo de tu nuida 
dela batalla del Boyne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son, generally called the Old Pretender, though born in 
England, was carried in his infancy to France, where he was 
brought up in the strictest principles of Popery, which 
principles, however, did not prevent him becoming (when did they 
ever prevent any one?) a worthless and profligate scoundrel; 
there are some doubts as to the reality of his being a son of 
James, which doubts are probably unfounded, the grand proof of 
his legitimacy being the thorough baseness of his 
character.&nbsp; It was said of his father that he could speak 
well, and it may be said of him that he could write well, the 
only thing he could do which was worth doing, always supposing 
that there is any merit in being able to write.&nbsp; He was of a
mean appearance, and, like his father, pusillanimous to a 
degree.&nbsp; The meanness of his appearance disgusted, and his 
pusillanimity discouraged the Scotch when he made his appearance 
amongst them in the year 1715, some time after the standard of 
rebellion had been hoisted by Mar.&nbsp; He only stayed a short 
time in Scotland, and then, seized with panic, retreated to 
France, leaving his friends to shift for themselves as they best 
could.&nbsp; He died a pensioner of the Pope.</p>
<p>The son of this man, Charles Edward, of whom so much in latter
years has been said and written, was a worthless, ignorant youth,
and a profligate and illiterate old man.&nbsp; When young, the 
best that can be said of him is, that he had occasionally springs
of courage, invariably at the wrong time and place, which merely 
served to lead his friends into inextricable difficulties.&nbsp; 
When old, he was loathsome and contemptible to both friend and 
foe.&nbsp; His <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>wife loathed him, and for the most 
terrible of reasons; she did not pollute his couch, for to do 
that was impossible&mdash;he had made it so vile; but she 
betrayed it, inviting to it not only Alfieri the Filthy, but the 
coarsest grooms.&nbsp; Dr. King, the warmest and almost last 
adherent of his family, said that there was not a vice or crime 
of which he was not guilty; as for his foes, they scorned to harm
him even when in their power.&nbsp; In the year 1745 he came down
from the Highlands of Scotland, which had long been a focus of 
rebellion.&nbsp; He was attended by certain clans of the 
Highlands, desperadoes used to freebootery from their infancy, 
and consequently to the use of arms, and possessed of a certain 
species of discipline; with these he defeated at Prestonpans a 
body of men called soldiers, but who were in reality peasants and
artisans, levied about a month before, without discipline or 
confidence in each other, and who were miserably massacred by the
Highland army; he subsequently invaded England, nearly destitute 
of regular soldiers, and penetrated as far as Derby, from which 
place he retreated on learning that regular forces which had been
hastily recalled from Flanders were coming against him, with the 
Duke of Cumberland at their head; he was pursued, and his rear 
guard overtaken and defeated by the dragoons of the duke at 
Clifton, from which place the rebels retreated in great confusion
across the Eden into Scotland, where they commenced dancing 
Highland reels and strathspeys on the bank of the river, for joy 
at their escape, whilst a number of wretched girls, paramours of 
some of them, were perishing in the waters of the swollen river 
in an attempt to follow them; they themselves passed over by 
eighties and by hundreds, arm in arm, for mutual safety, without 
the loss of a man, but they left the poor paramours to shift for 
themselves, nor did any of these canny people after passing the 
stream dash back to rescue a single female life,&mdash;no, they 
were too well employed upon the bank in dancing strathspeys to 
the tune of &ldquo;Charlie o&rsquo;er the water.&rdquo;&nbsp; It 
was, indeed, Charlie o&rsquo;er the water, and canny Highlanders 
o&rsquo;er the water, but where were the poor prostitutes 
meantime?&nbsp; <i>In the water</i>.</p>
<p>The Jacobite farce, or tragedy, was speedily brought to a 
close by the battle of Culloden; there did Charlie wish himself 
back again o&rsquo;er the water, exhibiting the most unmistakable
signs of pusillanimity; there were the clans cut to pieces, at 
least those who could be brought to the charge, and there fell 
Giles Mac Bean, or as he was called in Gaelic, Giliosa Mac 
Beathan, a kind of giant, six feet four inches and a quarter 
high, &ldquo;than whom,&rdquo; as his wife said in a coronach she
made upon him, &ldquo;no man who stood at Cuiloitr was 
taller&rdquo;&mdash;Giles Mac Bean the Major of the clan 
Cattan&mdash;a great drinker&mdash;a great fisher&mdash;a great 
shooter, and the champion of the Highland host.</p>
<p>The last of the Stuarts was a cardinal.</p>
<p>Such were the Stuarts, such their miserable history.&nbsp; 
They were <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>dead and buried in every sense of 
the word until Scott resuscitated them&mdash;how? by the power of
fine writing, and by calling to his aid that strange divinity, 
gentility.&nbsp; He wrote splendid novels about the Stuarts, in 
which he represents them as unlike what they really were as the 
graceful and beautiful papillon is unlike the hideous and filthy 
worm.&nbsp; In a word, he made them genteel, and that was enough 
to give them paramount sway over the minds of the British 
people.&nbsp; The public became Stuart-mad, and everybody, 
especially the women, said, &ldquo;What a pity it was that we 
hadn&rsquo;t a Stuart to govern.&rdquo;&nbsp; All parties, Whig, 
Tory, or Radical, became Jacobite at heart, and admirers of 
absolute power.&nbsp; The Whigs talked about the liberty of the 
subject, and the Radicals about the rights of man still, but 
neither party cared a straw for what it talked about, and 
mentally swore that, as soon as by means of such stuff they could
get places, and fill their pockets, they would be as Jacobite as 
the Jacobs themselves.&nbsp; As for the Tories, no great change 
in them was necessary; everything favouring absolutism and 
slavery being congenial to them.&nbsp; So the whole nation, that 
is, the reading part of the nation, with some exceptions, for 
thank God there has always been some salt in England, went over 
the water to Charlie.&nbsp; But going over to Charlie was not 
enough, they must, or at least a considerable part of them, go 
over to Rome too, or have a hankering to do so.&nbsp; As the 
Priest sarcastically observes in the text, &ldquo;As all the 
Jacobs were Papists, so the good folks who through Scott&rsquo;s 
novels admire the Jacobs must be Papists too.&rdquo;&nbsp; An 
idea got about that the religion of such genteel people as the 
Stuarts must be the climax of gentility, and that idea was quite 
sufficient.&nbsp; Only let a thing, whether temporal or 
spiritual, be considered genteel in England, and if it be not 
followed it is strange indeed; so Scott&rsquo;s writings not only
made the greater part of the nation Jacobite, but Popish.</p>
<p>Here some people will exclaim&mdash;whose opinions remain 
sound and uncontaminated&mdash;what you say is perhaps true with 
respect to the Jacobite nonsense at present so prevalent being 
derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels, but the Popish nonsense, which
people of the genteeler class are so fond of, is derived from 
Oxford.&nbsp; We sent our sons to Oxford nice honest lads, 
educated in the principles of the Church of England, and at the 
end of the first term they came home puppies, talking Popish 
nonsense, which they had learned from the pedants to whose care 
we had entrusted them; ay, not only Popery, but Jacobitism, which
they hardly carried with them from home, for we never heard them 
talking Jacobitism before they had been at Oxford; but now their 
conversation is a farrago of Popish and Jacobite 
stuff&mdash;&ldquo;Complines and Claverse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, what
these honest folks say is, to a certain extent, founded on fact; 
the Popery which has overflowed the land during the last fourteen
or fifteen years, has come immediately from Oxford, and likewise 
some of the Jacobitism, Popish and Jacobite nonsense, and little 
<!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
331</span>or nothing else, having been taught at Oxford for about
that number of years.&nbsp; But whence did the pedants get the 
Popish nonsense with which they have corrupted youth?&nbsp; Why, 
from the same quarter from which they got the Jacobite nonsense 
with which they have inoculated those lads who were not 
inoculated with it before&mdash;Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; 
Jacobitism and Laudism, a kind of half Popery, had at one time 
been very prevalent at Oxford, but both had been long consigned 
to oblivion there, and people at Oxford cared as little about 
Laud as they did about the Pretender.&nbsp; Both were dead and 
buried there, as everywhere else, till Scott called them out of 
their graves, when the pedants of Oxford hailed both&mdash;ay, 
and the Pope, too, as soon as Scott had made the old fellow 
fascinating, through particular novels, more especially the 
&ldquo;Monastery&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abbot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the 
quiet, respectable, honourable Church of England would no longer 
do for the pedants of Oxford; they must belong to a more genteel 
Church&mdash;they were ashamed at first to be downright 
Romans&mdash;so they would be Lauds.&nbsp; The pale-looking, but 
exceedingly genteel non-juring clergyman in 
&ldquo;Waverley&rdquo; was a Laud; but they soon became tired of 
being Lauds, for Laud&rsquo;s Church, gewgawish and idolatrous as
it was, was not sufficiently tinselly and idolatrous for them, so
they must be Popes, but in a sneaking way, still calling 
themselves Church of England men, in order to batten on the 
bounty of the Church which they were betraying, and likewise have
opportunities of corrupting such lads as might still resort to 
Oxford with principles uncontaminated.&nbsp; So the respectable 
people, whose opinions are still sound, are, to a certain extent,
right when they say that the tide of Popery, which has flowed 
over the land, has come from Oxford.&nbsp; It did come 
immediately from Oxford, but how did it get to Oxford?&nbsp; Why,
from Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Oh! that sermon which was the 
first manifestation of Oxford feeling, preached at Oxford some 
time in the year &rsquo;38 by a divine of a weak and confused 
intellect, in which Popery was mixed up with Jacobitism?&nbsp; 
The present writer remembers perfectly well, on reading some 
extracts from it at the time in a newspaper, on the top of a 
coach, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Why, the simpleton has been 
pilfering from Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O Oxford pedants!&nbsp; Oxford pedants! ye whose politics and 
religion are both derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels! what a pity 
it is that some lad of honest parents, whose mind ye are 
endeavouring to stultify with your nonsense about 
&ldquo;Complines and Claverse,&rdquo; has not the spirit to start
up and cry, &ldquo;Confound your gibberish!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
none of it.&nbsp; Hurrah for the Church, and the principles of my
<i>father</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; SAME SUBJECT 
CONTINUED.</h3>
<p>Now what could have induced Scott to write novels tending to 
make people Papists and Jacobites, and in love with arbitrary 
power?&nbsp; Did he think that Christianity was a gaudy 
mummery?&nbsp; He did not, he could not, for he had read the 
Bible; yet was he fond of gaudy mummeries, fond of talking about 
them.&nbsp; Did he believe that the Stuarts were a good family, 
and fit to govern a country like Britain?&nbsp; He knew that they
were a vicious, worthless crew, and that Britain was a degraded 
country as long as they swayed the sceptre; but for those facts 
he cared nothing, they governed in a way which he liked, for he 
had an abstract love of despotism, and an abhorrence of 
everything savouring of freedom and the rights of man in 
general.&nbsp; His favourite political picture was a joking, 
profligate, careless king, nominally absolute&mdash;the heads of 
great houses paying court to, but in reality governing, that 
king, whilst revelling with him on the plunder of a nation, and a
set of crouching, grovelling vassals (the literal meaning of 
vassal is a wretch), who, after allowing themselves to be 
horsewhipped, would take a bone if flung to them, and be 
grateful; so that in love with mummery, though he knew what 
Christianity was, no wonder he admired such a church as that of 
Rome, and that which Laud set up; and by nature formed to be the 
holder of the candle to ancient worm-eaten and profligate 
families, no wonder that all his sympathies were with the Stuarts
and their dissipated insolent party, and all his hatred directed 
against those who endeavoured to check them in their proceedings,
and to raise the generality of mankind something above a state of
vassalage that is wretchedness.&nbsp; Those who were born great, 
were, if he could have had his will, always to remain great, 
however worthless their characters.&nbsp; Those who were born 
low, were always to remain so, however great their 
talents&mdash;though if that rule were carried out, where would 
he have been himself?</p>
<p>In the book which he called the &ldquo;History of Napoleon 
Bonaparte,&rdquo; in which he plays the sycophant to all the 
legitimate crowned heads in Europe, whatever their crimes, vices,
or miserable imbecilities, he, in his abhorrence of everything 
low which by its own vigour makes itself illustrious, calls Murat
of the sabre the son of a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise 
pastry-cook.&nbsp; It is a pity that people who give themselves 
hoity-toity airs&mdash;and the Scotch in general are wonderfully 
addicted to giving themselves hoity-toity airs, and checking 
people better than themselves with their birth <a 
name="citation332"></a><a href="#footnote332" 
class="citation">[332]</a> <!-- page 333--><a 
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>and their 
country&mdash;it is a great pity that such people do not look at 
home&mdash;son of a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise 
pastry-cook!&nbsp; Well, and what was Scott himself?&nbsp; Why, 
son of a pettifogger, of an Edinburgh pettifogger.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh, but Scott was descended from the old cow-stealers of 
Buccleuch, and therefore . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Descended from old 
cow-stealers, was he?&nbsp; Well, had he had nothing to boast of 
beyond such a pedigree, he would have lived and died the son of a
pettifogger, and been forgotten, and deservedly so; but he 
possessed talents, and by his talents rose like Murat, and like 
him will be remembered for his talents alone, and deservedly 
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but Murat was still the son of a 
pastry-cook, and though he was certainly good at the sabre, and 
cut his way to a throne, still . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord! what 
fools there are in the world; but as no one can be thought 
anything of in this world without a pedigree, the writer will now
give a pedigree for Murat, of a very different character from the
cow-stealing one of Scott, but such a one as the proudest he 
might not disdain to claim.&nbsp; Scott was descended from the 
old cow-stealers of Buccleuch&mdash;was he?&nbsp; Good! and Murat
was descended from the old Moors of Spain, from the Abencerages 
(sons of the saddle) of Granada.&nbsp; The name Murat is Arabic, 
and is the same as Murad (Le Desir&eacute;, or the wished-for 
one).&nbsp; Scott, in his genteel life of Bonaparte, says that 
&ldquo;when Murat was in Egypt, the similarity between the name 
of the celebrated Mameluke Mourad and that of Bonaparte&rsquo;s 
Meilleur Sabreur was remarked, and became the subject of jest 
amongst the comrades of the gallant Frenchman.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
the writer of the novel of Bonaparte did not know that the names 
were one and the same.&nbsp; Now which was the best pedigree, 
that of the son of the pastry-cook, or that of the son of the 
pettifogger?&nbsp; Which was the best blood?&nbsp; Let us observe
the workings of the two bloods.&nbsp; He who had the blood of the
&ldquo;sons of the saddle&rdquo; in him became the wonderful 
cavalier of the most wonderful host that ever went forth to 
conquest, won for himself a crown, and died the death of a 
soldier, leaving behind him a son, only inferior to himself in 
strength, in prowess, and in horsemanship.&nbsp; The descendant 
of the cow-stealer became a poet, a novel writer, the panegyrist 
of great folks and genteel people; became insolvent because, 
though an author, he deemed it ungenteel to be mixed up with the 
business part of authorship; died paralytic and broken-hearted 
because he could no longer give entertainments to great folks; 
leaving behind him, <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>amongst other children, who were 
never heard of, a son, who through his father&rsquo;s interest, 
had become lieutenant-colonel in a genteel cavalry 
regiment.&nbsp; A son who was ashamed of his father because his 
father was an author; a son who&mdash;paugh&mdash;why ask which 
was the best blood!</p>
<p>So, owing to his rage for gentility, Scott must needs become 
the apologist of the Stuarts and their party; but God made this 
man pay dearly for taking the part of the wicked against the 
good; for lauding up to the skies miscreants and robbers, and 
calumniating the noble spirits of Britain, the salt of England, 
and his own country.&nbsp; As God had driven the Stuarts from 
their throne, and their followers from their estates, making them
vagabonds and beggars on the face of the earth, taking from them 
all they cared for, so did that same God, who knows perfectly 
well how and where to strike, deprive the apologist of that 
wretched crew of all that rendered life pleasant in his eyes, the
lack of which paralysed him in body and mind, rendered him 
pitiable to others, loathsome to himself,&mdash;so much so, that 
he once said, &ldquo;Where is the beggar who would change places 
with me, notwithstanding all my fame?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; God 
knows perfectly well how to strike.&nbsp; He permitted him to 
retain all his literary fame to the very last&mdash;his literary 
fame for which he cared nothing; but what became of the 
sweetnesses of life, his fine house, his grand company, and his 
entertainments?&nbsp; The grand house ceased to be his; he was 
only permitted to live in it on sufferance, and whatever grandeur
it might still retain, it soon became as desolate a looking house
as any misanthrope could wish to see&mdash;where were the grand 
entertainments and the grand company? there are no grand 
entertainments where there is no money; no lords and ladies where
there are no entertainments&mdash;and there lay the poor lodger 
in the desolate house, groaning on a bed no longer his, smitten 
by the hand of God in the part where he was most 
vulnerable.&nbsp; Of what use telling such a man to take comfort,
for he had written the &ldquo;Minstrel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rob 
Roy,&rdquo;&mdash;telling him to think of his literary

gentility:&mdash;</p>

<p>He dies, his children die too, and then comes the crowning 
judgment of God on what remained of his race, and the house which
he had built.&nbsp; He was not a Papist himself, nor did he wish 
any one belonging to him to be Popish, for he had read enough of 
the Bible to know that no one can be saved through Popery, yet 
had he a sneaking affection for it, and would at all times, in an
underhand manner, give it a good word both in writing and 
discourse, because it was a gaudy kind of worship, and ignorance 
and vassalage prevailed so long as it flourished&mdash;but he 
certainly <!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>did not wish any of his people to 
become Papists, nor the house which he had built to become a 
Popish house, though the very name he gave it savoured of Popery;
but Popery becomes fashionable through his novels and 
poems&mdash;the only one that remains of his race, a female 
grandchild, marries a person who, following the fashion, becomes 
a Papist, and makes her a Papist too.&nbsp; Money abounds with 
the husband, who buys the house, and then the house becomes the 
rankest Popish house in Britain.&nbsp; A superstitious person 
might almost imagine that one of the old Scottish Covenanters, 
whilst the grand house was being built from the profits resulting
from the sale of writings favouring Popery and persecution, and 
calumniatory of Scotland&rsquo;s saints and martyrs, had risen 
from the grave, and banned Scott, his race, and his house, by 
reading a certain psalm.</p>
<p>In saying what he has said about Scott, the author has not 
been influenced by any feeling of malice or ill-will, but simply 
by a regard for truth, and a desire to point out to his 
countrymen the harm which has resulted from the perusal of his 
works;&mdash;he is not one of those who would depreciate the 
talents of Scott&mdash;he admires his talents, both as a prose 
writer and a poet; as a poet especially he admires him, and 
believes him to have been by far the greatest, with perhaps the 
exception of Mickiewicz, who only wrote for unfortunate Poland, 
that Europe has given birth to during the last hundred 
years.&nbsp; As a prose writer he admires him less, it is true, 
but his admiration for him in that capacity is very high, and he 
only laments that he prostituted his talents to the cause of the 
Stuarts and gentility.&nbsp; What book of fiction of the present 
century can you read twice, with the exception of 
&ldquo;Waverley&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo;?&nbsp; There is 
&ldquo;Pelham,&rdquo; it is true, which the writer of these lines
has seen a Jewess reading in the steppe of Debreczin, and which a
young Prussian Baron, a great traveller, whom he met at 
Constantinople in &rsquo;44, told him he always carried in his 
valise.&nbsp; And, in conclusion, he will say, in order to show 
the opinion which he entertains of the power of Scott as a 
writer, that he did for the spectre of the wretched Pretender 
what all the kings of Europe could not do for his 
body&mdash;placed it on the throne of these realms; and for 
Popery, what Popes and Cardinals strove in vain to do for three 
centuries&mdash;brought back its mummeries and nonsense into the 
temples of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Scott during his lifetime had a crowd of imitators, who, 
whether they wrote history so called&mdash;poetry so 
called&mdash;or novels&mdash;nobody would call a book a novel if 
he could call it anything else&mdash;wrote Charlie o&rsquo;er the
water nonsense; and now that he has been dead a quarter of a 
century, there are others daily springing up who are striving to 
imitate Scott in his Charlie o&rsquo;er the water 
nonsense&mdash;for nonsense it is, even when flowing from his 
pen.&nbsp; They, too, must write Jacobite histories, Jacobite 
songs, and Jacobite novels, and much the same figure as the 
scoundrel menials in the comedy <!-- page 336--><a 
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>cut when 
personating their masters, and retailing their masters&rsquo; 
conversation, do they cut as Walter Scotts.&nbsp; In their 
histories, they too talk about the Prince and Glenfinnan, and the
pibroch; and in their songs about &ldquo;Claverse&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Bonny Dundee.&rdquo;&nbsp; But though they may be Scots, 
they are not Walter Scotts.&nbsp; But it is perhaps chiefly in 
the novel that you see the veritable hog in armour; the time of 
the novel is of course the &rsquo;15 or &rsquo;45; the hero a 
Jacobite, and connected with one or other of the enterprises of 
those periods; and the author, to show how unprejudiced he is, 
and what <i>original</i> views he takes of subjects, must needs 
speak up for Popery, whenever he has occasion to mention it; 
though, with all his originality, when he brings his hero and the
vagabonds with which he is concerned before a barricadoed house, 
belonging to the Whigs, he can make them get into it by no other 
method than that which Scott makes his rioters employ to get into
the Tolbooth, <i>burning down</i> the door.</p>
<p>To express the more than utter foolishness of this latter 
Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense, whether in rhyme or prose,
there is but one word, and that word a Scotch word.&nbsp; Scotch,
the sorriest of jargons, compared with which even Roth Welsch is 
dignified and expressive, has yet one word to express what would 
be inexpressible by any word or combination of words in any 
language, or in any other jargon in the world; and very properly;
for as the nonsense is properly Scotch, so should the word be 
Scotch which expresses it&mdash;that word is 
&ldquo;fushionless,&rdquo; pronounced <i>fooshionless</i>; and 
when the writer has called the nonsense fooshionless&mdash;and he
does call it fooshionless&mdash;he has nothing more to say, but 
leaves the nonsense to its fate.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; ON CANTING NONSENSE.</h3>
<p>The writer now wishes to say something on the subject of 
canting nonsense, of which there is a great deal in 
England.&nbsp; There are various cants in England, amongst which 
is the religious cant.&nbsp; He is not going to discuss the 
subject of religious cant: lest, however, he should be 
misunderstood, he begs leave to repeat that he is a sincere 
member of the old-fashioned Church of England, in which he 
believes there is more religion, and consequently less cant, than
in any other church in the world; nor is he going to discuss many
other cants; he shall content himself with saying something about
two&mdash;the temperance cant and the unmanly cant.&nbsp; 
Temperance canters say that &ldquo;it is unlawful to drink a 
glass of ale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unmanly canters say that &ldquo;it is 
unlawful to use one&rsquo;s fists.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer begs 
leave to tell both these species of canters that they do not 
speak the words of truth.</p>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>It is very lawful to take a cup of ale, or wine, for 
the purpose of cheering or invigorating yourself when you are 
faint and downhearted; and likewise to give a cup of ale or wine 
to others when they are in a similar condition.&nbsp; The Holy 
Scripture sayeth nothing to the contrary, but rather encourageth 
people in so doing by the text, &ldquo;Wine maketh glad the heart
of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is not lawful to intoxicate yourself 
with frequent cups of ale or wine, nor to make others 
intoxicated, nor does the Holy Scripture say that it is.&nbsp; 
The Holy Scripture no more says that it is lawful to intoxicate 
yourself or others, than it says that it is unlawful to take a 
cup of ale or wine yourself, or to give one to others.&nbsp; Noah
is not commended in the Scripture for making himself drunken on 
the wine he brewed.&nbsp; Nor is it said that the Saviour, when 
He supplied the guests with first-rate wine at the marriage 
feast, told them to make themselves drunk upon it.&nbsp; He is 
said to have supplied them with first-rate wine, but He doubtless
left the quantity which each should drink to each party&rsquo;s 
reason and discretion.&nbsp; When you set a good dinner before 
your guests, you do not expect that they should gorge themselves 
with the victuals you set before them.&nbsp; Wine may be abused, 
and so may a leg of mutton.</p>
<p>Second.&nbsp; It is lawful for any one to use his fists in his
own defence, or in the defence of others, provided they 
can&rsquo;t help themselves; but it is not lawful to use them for
purposes of tyranny or brutality.&nbsp; If you are attacked by a 
ruffian, as the elderly individual in Lavengro is in the 
inn-yard, it is quite lawful, if you can, to give him as good a 
thrashing as the elderly individual gave the brutal coachman; and
if you see a helpless woman&mdash;perhaps your own 
sister&mdash;set upon by a drunken lord, a drunken coachman, or a
drunken coalheaver, or a brute of any description, either drunk 
or sober, it is not only lawful, but laudable, to give them, if 
you can, a good drubbing: but it is not lawful, because you have 
a strong pair of fists, and know how to use them, to go 
swaggering through a fair, jostling against unoffending 
individuals; should you do so, you would be served quite right if
you were to get a drubbing, more particularly if you were served 
out by some one less strong, but more skilful than 
yourself&mdash;even as the coachman was served out by a pupil of 
the immortal Broughton&mdash;sixty years old, it is true, but 
possessed of Broughton&rsquo;s guard and chop.&nbsp; Moses is not
blamed in the Scripture for taking part with the oppressed, and 
killing an Egyptian persecutor.&nbsp; We are not told how Moses 
killed the Egyptian; but it is quite as creditable to Moses to 
suppose that he killed the Egyptian by giving him a buffet under 
the left ear, as by stabbing him with a knife.&nbsp; It is true, 
that the Saviour in the New Testament tells his disciples to turn
the left cheek to be smitten, after they had received a blow on 
the right; but He was speaking to people divinely inspired, or 
whom He intended divinely to inspire&mdash;people selected by God
for a particular purpose.&nbsp; He likewise tells these people to
part with various articles of raiment <!-- page 338--><a 
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>when asked 
for them, and to go a-travelling without money, and to take no 
thought of the morrow.&nbsp; Are those exhortations carried out 
by very good people in the present day?&nbsp; Do Quakers, when 
smitten on the right cheek, turn the left to the smiter?&nbsp; 
When asked for their coat, do they say, &ldquo;Friend, take my 
shirt also&rdquo;?&nbsp; Has the Dean of Salisbury no 
purse?&nbsp; Does the Archbishop of Canterbury go to an inn, run 
up a reckoning, and then say to his landlady, &ldquo;Mistress, I 
have no coin&rdquo;?&nbsp; Assuredly the Dean has a purse, and a 
tolerably well-filled one; and, assuredly, the Archbishop, on 
departing from an inn, not only settles his reckoning, but leaves
something handsome for the servants, and does not say that he is 
forbidden by the gospel to pay for what he has eaten, or the 
trouble he has given, as a certain Spanish cavalier said he was 
forbidden by the statutes of chivalry.&nbsp; Now, to take the 
part of yourself, or the part of the oppressed, with your fists, 
is quite as lawful in the present day as it is to refuse your 
coat and your shirt also to any vagabond who may ask for them, 
and not to refuse to pay for supper, bed, and breakfast, at the 
Feathers, or any other inn, after you have had the benefit of all
three.</p>
<p>The conduct of Lavengro with respect to drink may, upon the 
whole, serve as a model.&nbsp; He is no drunkard, nor is he fond 
of intoxicating other people; yet when the horrors are upon him 
he has no objection to go to a public-house and call for a pint 
of ale, nor does he shrink from recommending ale to others when 
they are faint and downcast.&nbsp; In one instance, it is true, 
he does what cannot be exactly justified; he encourages the 
Priest in the dingle, in more instances than one, in drinking 
more hollands and water than is consistent with decorum.&nbsp; He
has a motive indeed in doing so; a desire to learn from the knave
in his cups the plans and hopes of the Propaganda of Rome.&nbsp; 
Such conduct, however, was inconsistent with strict fair dealing 
and openness; and the author advises all those whose consciences 
never reproach them for a single unfair or covert act committed 
by them, to abuse him heartily for administering hollands and 
water to the Priest of Rome.&nbsp; In that instance the hero is 
certainly wrong; yet in all other cases with regard to drink, he 
is manifestly right.&nbsp; To tell people that they are never to 
drink a glass of ale or wine themselves, or to give one to 
others, is cant; and the writer has no toleration for cant of any
description.&nbsp; Some cants are not dangerous; but the writer 
believes that a more dangerous cant than the temperance cant, or 
as it is generally called, teetotalism, is scarcely to be 
found.&nbsp; The writer is willing to believe that it originated 
with well-meaning, though weak people; but there can be no doubt 
that it was quickly turned to account by people who were neither 
well meaning nor weak.&nbsp; Let the reader note particularly the
purpose to which this cry has been turned in America; the land, 
indeed, <i>par excellence</i>, of humbug and humbug cries.&nbsp; 
It is there continually in the mouth of the most violent 
political party, and is made an instrument of almost unexampled 
persecution.&nbsp; The writer would say more on the <!-- page 
339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
339</span>temperance cant, both in England and America, but want 
of space prevents him.&nbsp; There is one point on which he 
cannot avoid making a few brief remarks&mdash;that is the 
inconsistent conduct of its apostles in general.&nbsp; The 
teetotal apostle says, it is a dreadful thing to be drunk.&nbsp; 
So it is, teetotaller; but if so, why do you get drunk?&nbsp; I 
get drunk?&nbsp; Yes, unhappy man, why do you get drunk on smoke 
and passion?&nbsp; Why are your garments impregnated with the 
odour of the Indian weed?&nbsp; Why is there a pipe or a cigar 
always in your mouth?&nbsp; Why is your language more dreadful 
than that of a Poissarde?&nbsp; Tobacco-smoke is more deleterious
than ale, teetotaller; bile more potent than brandy.&nbsp; You 
are fond of telling your hearers what an awful thing it is to die
drunken.&nbsp; So it is, teetotaller.&nbsp; Then take good care 
that you do not die with smoke and passion, drunken, and with 
temperance language on your lips; that is, abuse and calumny 
against all those who differ from you.&nbsp; One word of sense 
you have been heard to say, which is, that spirits may be taken 
as a medicine.&nbsp; Now you are in a fever of passion, 
teetotaller; so, pray take this tumbler of brandy; take it on the
hom&oelig;opathic principle, that heat is to be expelled by 
heat.&nbsp; You are in a temperance fury, so swallow the contents
of this tumbler, and it will, perhaps, cure you.&nbsp; You look 
at the glass wistfully&mdash;you say you occasionally take a 
glass medicinally&mdash;and it is probable you do.&nbsp; Take one
now.&nbsp; Consider what a dreadful thing it would be to die 
passion drunk; to appear before your Maker with 
<i>in</i>temperate language on your lips.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 
right!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem to wince at the brandy.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s right!&mdash;well done!&nbsp; All down in two 
pulls.&nbsp; Now you look like a reasonable being!</p>
<p>If the conduct of Lavengro with regard to drink is open to 
little censure, assuredly the use which he makes of his fists is 
entitled to none at all.&nbsp; Because he has a pair of tolerably
strong fists, and knows to a certain extent how to use them, is 
he a swaggerer or oppressor?&nbsp; To what ill account does he 
turn them?&nbsp; Who more quiet, gentle, and inoffensive than 
he?&nbsp; He beats off a ruffian who attacks him in a dingle; has
a kind of friendly tussle with Mr. Petulengro, and behold the 
extent of his fistic exploits.</p>
<p>Ay, but he associates with prize-fighters; and that very 
fellow, Petulengro, is a prize-fighter, and has fought for a 
stake in a ring.&nbsp; Well, and if he had not associated with 
prize-fighters, how could he have used his fists?&nbsp; Oh, 
anybody can use his fists in his own defence, without being 
taught by prize-fighters.&nbsp; Can they?&nbsp; Then why does not
the Italian, or Spaniard, or Affghan use his fists when insulted 
or outraged, instead of having recourse to the weapons which he 
has recourse to?&nbsp; Nobody can use his fists without being 
taught the use of them by those who have themselves been taught, 
no more than any one can &ldquo;whiffle&rdquo; without being 
taught by a master of the art.&nbsp; Now let any man of the 
present day try to whiffle.&nbsp; Would not any one who wished to
whiffle have to go to a master of the art.&nbsp; Assuredly! but 
where would he find one at <!-- page 340--><a 
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>the present
day?&nbsp; The last of the whifflers hanged himself about a 
fortnight ago on a bell-rope in a church steeple of &ldquo;the 
old town,&rdquo; from pure grief that there was no further demand
for the exhibition of his art, there being no demand for 
whiffling since the discontinuation of Guildhall banquets.&nbsp; 
Whiffling is lost.&nbsp; The old chap left his sword behind him; 
let any one take up the old chap&rsquo;s sword and try to 
whiffle.&nbsp; Now much the same hand as he would make who should
take up the whiffler&rsquo;s sword and try to whiffle, would he 
who should try to use his fists who had never had the advantage 
of a master.&nbsp; Let no one think that men use their fists 
naturally in their own disputes&mdash;men have naturally recourse
to any other thing to defend themselves or to offend others; they
fly to the stick, to the stone, to the murderous and cowardly 
knife, or to abuse as cowardly as the knife, and occasionally 
more murderous.&nbsp; Now which is best when you hate a person, 
or have a pique against a person, to clench your fist and say 
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; or to have recourse to the stone, the 
knife, or murderous calumny?&nbsp; The use of the fist is almost 
lost in England.&nbsp; Yet are the people better than they were 
when they knew how to use their fists?&nbsp; The writer believes 
not.&nbsp; A fisty combat is at present a great rarity, but the 
use of the knife, the noose, and of poison, to say nothing of 
calumny, are of more frequent occurrence in England than perhaps 
in any country in Europe.&nbsp; Is polite taste better than when 
it could bear the details of a fight?&nbsp; The writer believes 
not.&nbsp; Two men cannot meet in a ring to settle a dispute in a
manly manner without some trumpery local newspaper letting loose 
a volley of abuse against &ldquo;the disgraceful 
exhibition,&rdquo; in which abuse it is sure to be sanctioned by 
its dainty readers; whereas some murderous horror, the discovery,
for example, of the mangled remains of a woman in some obscure 
den, is greedily seized hold on by the moral journal, and dressed
up for its readers, who luxuriate and gloat upon the ghastly 
dish.&nbsp; Now, the writer of Lavengro has no sympathy with 
those who would shrink from striking a blow, but would not shrink
from the use of poison or calumny; and his taste has little in 
common with that which cannot tolerate the hardy details of a 
prize-fight, but which luxuriates on descriptions of the murder 
dens of modern England.&nbsp; But prize-fighters and pugilists 
are blackguards, a reviewer has said; and blackguards they would 
be provided they employed their skill and their prowess for 
purposes of brutality and oppression; but prize-fighters and 
pugilists are seldom friends to brutality and oppression; and 
which is the blackguard, the writer would ask, he who uses his 
fists to take his own part, or instructs others to use theirs for
the same purpose, or the being who from envy and malice, or at 
the bidding of a malicious scoundrel, endeavours by calumny, 
falsehood, and misrepresentation to impede the efforts of lonely 
and unprotected genius?</p>
<p>One word more about the race, all but extinct, of the people 
<!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
341</span>opprobriously called prize-fighters.&nbsp; Some of them
have been as noble, kindly men as the world ever produced.&nbsp; 
Can the rolls of the English aristocracy exhibit names belonging 
to more noble, more heroic men than those who were called 
respectively Pearce, Cribb, and Spring?&nbsp; Did ever one of the
English aristocracy contract the seeds of fatal consumption by 
rushing up the stairs of a burning edifice, even to the topmost 
garret, and rescuing a woman from seemingly inevitable 
destruction?&nbsp; The writer says No.&nbsp; A woman was rescued 
from the top of a burning house; but the man who rescued her was 
no aristocrat; it was Pearce, not Percy, who ran up the burning 
stairs.&nbsp; Did ever one of those glittering ones save a 
fainting female from the libidinous rage of six ruffians?&nbsp; 
The writer believes not.&nbsp; A woman was rescued from the 
libidinous fury of six monsters on . . . Down; but the man who 
rescued her was no aristocrat; it was Pearce, not Paulet, who 
rescued the woman, and thrashed my lord&rsquo;s six 
gamekeepers&mdash;Pearce, whose equal never was, and probably 
never will be, found in sturdy combat.&nbsp; Are there any of the
aristocracy of whom it can be said that they never did a 
cowardly, cruel, or mean action, and that they invariably took 
the part of the unfortunate and weak against cruelty and 
oppression?&nbsp; As much can be said of Cribb, of Spring, and 
the other; but where is the aristocrat of whom as much can be 
said?&nbsp; Wellington?&nbsp; Wellington, indeed! a skilful 
general, and a good man of valour, it is true, but with that cant
word of &ldquo;duty&rdquo; continually on his lips, did he rescue
Ney from his butchers?&nbsp; Did he lend a helping hand to 
Warner?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer would strongly advise those of his 
country-folks who may read his book to have nothing to do with 
the two kinds of canting nonsense described above, but in their 
progress through life to enjoy as well as they can, but always 
with moderation, the good things of this world, to put confidence
in God, to be as independent as possible, and to take their own 
parts.&nbsp; If they are low-spirited, let them not make 
themselves foolish by putting on sackcloth, drinking water, or 
chewing ashes, but let them take wholesome exercise, and eat the 
most generous food they can get, taking up and reading 
occasionally, not the lives of Ignatius Loyola and Francis Spira,
but something more agreeable; for example, the life and 
adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell, the deaf and dumb gentleman; 
the travels of Captain Falconer in America, and the Journal of 
John Randall, who went to Virginia and married an Indian wife; 
not forgetting, amidst their eating and drinking, their walks 
over heaths, and by the sea-side, and their agreeable literature,
to be charitable to the poor, to read the Psalms, and to go to 
church twice on a Sunday.&nbsp; In their dealings with people, to
be courteous to everybody, as Lavengro was, but always 
independent like him; and if people meddle with them, to give 
them as good as they bring, even as he and Isopel Berners were in
the habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to observe 
<!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
342</span>that he by no means advises women to be too womanly, 
but bearing the conduct of Isopel Berners in mind, to take their 
own parts, and if anybody strikes them, to strike again.</p>
<p>Beating of women by the lords of the creation has become very 
prevalent in England since pugilism has been 
discountenanced.&nbsp; Now the writer strongly advises any woman 
who is struck by a ruffian to strike him again; or if she cannot 
clench her fists, and he advises all women in these singular 
times to learn to clench their fists, to go at him with tooth and
nail, and not to be afraid of the result, for any fellow who is 
dastard enough to strike a woman, would allow himself to be 
beaten by a woman, were she to make at him in self-defence, even 
if, instead of possessing the stately height and athletic 
proportions of the aforesaid Isopel, she were as diminutive in 
stature, and had a hand as delicate, and a foot as small, as a 
certain royal lady, who was some time ago assaulted by a fellow 
upwards of six feet high, whom the writer has no doubt she could 
have beaten had she thought proper to go at him.&nbsp; Such is 
the deliberate advice of the author to his countrymen and 
women&mdash;advice in which he believes there is nothing 
unscriptural or repugnant to common sense.</p>
<p>The writer is perfectly well aware that, by the plain language
which he has used in speaking of the various kinds of nonsense 
prevalent in England, he shall make himself a multitude of 
enemies; but he is not going to conceal the truth, or to tamper 
with nonsense, from the fear of provoking hostility.&nbsp; He has
a duty to perform, and he will perform it resolutely; he is the 
person who carried the Bible to Spain; and as resolutely as he 
spoke in Spain against the superstitions of Spain, will he speak 
in England against the nonsense of his own native land.&nbsp; He 
is not one of those who, before they sit down to write a book, 
say to themselves, what cry shall we take up? what principles 
shall we advocate? what principles shall we abuse? before we put 
pen to paper we must find out what cry is the loudest, what 
principle has the most advocates, otherwise, after having written
our book, we may find ourselves on the weaker side.</p>
<p>A sailor of the &ldquo;Bounty,&rdquo; waked from his sleep by 
the noise of the mutiny, lay still in his hammock for some time, 
quite undecided whether to take part with the captain, or to join
the mutineers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must mind what I do,&rdquo; said he
to himself, &ldquo;lest, in the end, I find myself on the weaker 
side;&rdquo; finally, on hearing that the mutineers were 
successful, he went on deck, and seeing Bligh pinioned to the 
mast, he put his fist to his nose, and otherwise insulted 
him.&nbsp; Now, there are many writers of the present day whose 
conduct is very similar to that of the sailor.&nbsp; They lie 
listening in their corners till they have ascertained which 
principle has most advocates; then, presently, they make their 
appearance on the deck of the world with their book; if truth has
been victorious, then has truth their hurrah! but if truth is 
pinioned <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>against the mast, then is their fist
thrust against the nose of truth, and their gibe and their insult
spirted in her face.&nbsp; The strongest party had the sailor, 
and the strongest party has almost invariably the writer of the 
present day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; PSEUDO-CRITICS.</h3>
<p>A certain set of individuals calling themselves critics have 
attacked Lavengro with much virulence and malice.&nbsp; If what 
they call criticism had been founded on truth, the author would 
have had nothing to say.&nbsp; The book contains plenty of 
blemishes, some of them, by-the-bye, wilful ones, as the writer 
will presently show; not one of these, however, has been detected
and pointed out; but the best passages in the book, indeed 
whatever was calculated to make the book valuable, have been 
assailed with abuse and misrepresentation.&nbsp; The duty of the 
true critic is to play the part of a leech, and not of a 
viper.&nbsp; Upon true and upon malignant criticism there is an 
excellent fable by the Spaniard Iriarte.&nbsp; The viper says to 
the leech, &ldquo;Why do people invite your bite, and flee from 
mine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says the leech, 
&ldquo;people receive health from my bite, and poison from 
yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is as much difference,&rdquo; 
says the clever Spaniard, &ldquo;between true and malignant 
criticism, as between poison and medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly
a great many meritorious writers have allowed themselves to be 
poisoned by malignant criticism; the writer, however, is not one 
of those who allow themselves to be poisoned by pseudo-critics; 
no! no! he will rather hold them up by their tails, and show the 
creatures wriggling, blood and foam streaming from their broken 
jaws.&nbsp; First of all, however, he will notice one of their 
objections.&nbsp; &ldquo;The book isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; say 
they.&nbsp; Now one of the principal reasons with those that have
attacked Lavengro for their abuse of it is, that it is 
particularly true in one instance, namely, that it exposes their 
own nonsense, their love of humbug, their slavishness, their 
dressings, their goings out, their scraping and bowing to great 
people; it is the showing up of &ldquo;gentility nonsense&rdquo; 
in Lavengro that has been one principal reason for the raising of
the above cry; for in Lavengro is denounced the besetting folly 
of the English people, a folly which those who call themselves 
guardians of the public taste are far from being above.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t abide anything that isn&rsquo;t 
true!&rdquo; they exclaim.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Then why
are they so enraptured with any fiction that is adapted to 
purposes of humbug, which tends to make them satisfied with their
own proceedings, with their own nonsense, which does not tell 
them to reform, to become more alive to their own failings, and 
less sensitive about <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>the tyrannical goings on of the 
masters, and the degraded condition, the sufferings, and the 
trials of the serfs in the star Jupiter?&nbsp; Had Lavengro, 
instead of being the work of an independent mind, been written in
order to further any of the thousand and one cants, and species 
of nonsense prevalent in England, the author would have heard 
much less about its not being true, both from public detractors 
and private censurers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lavengro pretends to be an autobiography,&rdquo; 
say the critics; and here the writer begs leave to observe, that 
it would be well for people who profess to have a regard for 
truth, not to exhibit in every assertion which they make a most 
profligate disregard of it; this assertion of theirs is a 
falsehood, and they know it to be a falsehood.&nbsp; In the 
preface Lavengro is stated to be a dream; and the writer takes 
this opportunity of stating that he never said it was an 
autobiography; never authorised any person to say that it was 
one; and that he has in innumerable instances declared in public 
and private, both before and after the work was published, that 
it was not what is generally termed an autobiography: but a set 
of people who pretend to write criticisms on books, hating the 
author for various reasons,&mdash;amongst others, because, having
the proper pride of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not, in the
year &rsquo;43, choose to permit himself to be exhibited and made
a zany of in London, and especially because he will neither 
associate with, nor curry favour with, them who are neither 
gentlemen nor scholars,&mdash;attack his book with abuse and 
calumny.&nbsp; He is, perhaps, condescending too much when he 
takes any notice of such people; as, however, the English public 
is wonderfully led by cries and shouts, and generally ready to 
take part against any person who is either unwilling or unable to
defend himself, he deems it advisable not to be altogether quiet 
with those who assail him.&nbsp; The best way to deal with vipers
is to tear out their teeth; and the best way to deal with 
pseudo-critics is to deprive them of their poison-bag, which is 
easily done by exposing their ignorance.&nbsp; The writer knew 
perfectly well the description of people with whom he would have 
to do, he therefore very quietly prepared a stratagem, by means 
of which he could at any time exhibit them, powerless and 
helpless, in his hand.&nbsp; Critics, when they review books, 
ought to have a competent knowledge of the subjects which those 
books discuss.</p>
<p>Lavengro is a philological book, a poem if you choose to call 
it so.&nbsp; Now, what a fine triumph it would have been for 
those who wished to vilify the book and its author, provided they
could have detected the latter tripping in his 
philology&mdash;they might have instantly said that he was an 
ignorant pretender to philology&mdash;they laughed at the idea of
his taking up a viper by its tail, a trick which hundreds of 
country urchins do every September, but they were silent about 
the really wonderful part of the book, the philological 
matter&mdash;they thought philology was his stronghold, and <!-- 
page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
345</span>that it would be useless to attack him there; they of 
course would give him no credit as a philologist, for anything 
like fair treatment towards him was not to be expected at their 
hands, but they were afraid to attack his philology&mdash;yet 
that was the point, and the only point, in which they might have 
attacked him successfully; he was vulnerable there.&nbsp; How was
this?&nbsp; Why, in order to have an opportunity of holding up 
pseudo-critics by the tails, he wilfully spelt various foreign 
words wrong&mdash;Welsh words, and even Italian words&mdash;did 
they detect these misspellings? not one of them, even as he knew 
they would not, and he now taunts them with ignorance; and the 
power of taunting them with ignorance is the punishment which he 
designed for them&mdash;a power which they might but for their 
ignorance have used against him.&nbsp; The writer, besides 
knowing something of Italian and Welsh, knows a little of 
Armenian language and literature, but who knowing anything of the
Armenian language, unless he had an end in view, would say that 
the word for sea in Armenian is anything like the word tide in 
English?&nbsp; The word for sea in Armenian is dzow, a word 
connected with the Tebetian word for water, and the Chinese shuy,
and the Turkish su, signifying the same thing; but where is the 
resemblance between dzow and tide?&nbsp; Again, the word for 
bread in ancient Armenian is hats; yet the Armenian on London 
Bridge is made to say zhats, which is not the nominative of the 
Armenian noun for bread, but the accusative: now, critics, 
ravening against a man because he is a gentleman and a scholar, 
and has not only the power but also the courage to write original
works, why did not you discover that weak point?&nbsp; Why, 
because you were ignorant, so here ye are held up!&nbsp; 
Moreover, who with a name commencing with Z, ever wrote fables in
Armenian?&nbsp; There are two writers of fables in 
Armenian&mdash;Varthan and Koscht, and illustrious writers they 
are, one in the simple, and the other in the ornate style of 
Armenian composition, but neither of their names begins with a 
Z.&nbsp; Oh, what a precious opportunity ye lost, ye ravening 
crew, of convicting the poor, half-starved, friendless boy of the
book, of ignorance or misrepresentation, by asking who with a 
name beginning with Z ever wrote fables in Armenian; but ye 
couldn&rsquo;t help yourselves, ye are duncie.&nbsp; We 
duncie!&nbsp; Ay, duncie.&nbsp; So here ye are held up by the 
tails, blood and foam streaming from your jaws.</p>
<p>The writer wishes to ask here, what do you think of all this, 
Messieurs les Critiques?&nbsp; Were ye ever served so 
before?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you richly deserve it?&nbsp; 
Haven&rsquo;t you been for years past bullying and insulting 
everybody whom you deemed weak, and currying favour with 
everybody whom ye thought strong?&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>We</i> approve 
of this.&nbsp; We disapprove of that.&nbsp; Oh, this will never 
do.&nbsp; These are fine lines!&rdquo;&nbsp; The lines perhaps 
some horrid sycophantic rubbish addressed to Wellington, or Lord 
So-and-so.&nbsp; To have your ignorance thus exposed, to be shown
up in this manner, and <!-- page 346--><a 
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>by 
whom?&nbsp; A gypsy!&nbsp; Ay, a gypsy was the very right person 
to do it.&nbsp; But is it not galling after all?</p>
<p>Ah, but <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t understand Armenian, it cannot 
be expected that <i>we</i> should understand Armenian, or Welsh, 
or . . . Hey, what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; The mighty <i>we</i> not 
understand Armenian or Welsh, or . . . Then why does the mighty 
<i>we</i> pretend to review a book like Lavengro?&nbsp; From the 
arrogance with which it continually delivers itself, one would 
think that the mighty <i>we</i> is omniscient; that it 
understands every language; is versed in every literature; yet 
the mighty <i>we</i> does not even know the word for bread in 
Armenian.&nbsp; It knows bread well enough by name in English, 
and frequently bread in England only by its name, but the truth 
is, that the mighty <i>we</i>, with all its pretension, is in 
general a very sorry creature, who, instead of saying nous 
disons, should rather say nous dis: Porny in his &ldquo;Guerre 
des Dieux,&rdquo; very profanely makes the three in one say, Je 
faisons; now, Lavengro, who is anything but profane, would 
suggest that critics, especially magazine and Sunday newspaper 
critics, should commence with nous dis, as the first word would 
be significant of the conceit and assumption of the critic, and 
the second of the extent of the critic&rsquo;s information.&nbsp;
The <i>we</i> says its say, but when fawning sycophancy or vulgar
abuse are taken from that say, what remains?&nbsp; Why a blank, a
void like Ginnungagap.</p>
<p>As the writer, of his own accord, has exposed some of the 
blemishes of his book&mdash;a task which a competent critic ought
to have done&mdash;he will now point out two or three of its 
merits, which any critic, not altogether blinded with ignorance, 
might have done, or not replete with gall and envy would have 
been glad to do.&nbsp; The book has the merit of communicating a 
fact connected with physiology, which in all the pages of the 
multitude of books was never previously mentioned&mdash;the 
mysterious practice of touching objects to baffle the evil 
chance.&nbsp; The miserable detractor will, of course, instantly 
begin to rave about such a habit being common: well and good; but
was it ever before described in print, or all connected with it 
dissected?&nbsp; He may then vociferate something about Johnson 
having touched:&mdash;the writer cares not whether 
Johnson&mdash;who, by-the-bye, during the last twenty or thirty 
years, owing to people having become ultra Tory mad from reading 
Scott&rsquo;s novels and the &ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; has 
been a mighty favourite, especially with some who were in the 
habit of calling him a half crazy old fool&mdash;touched, or 
whether he did not; but he asks where did Johnson ever describe 
the feelings which induced him to perform the magic touch, even 
supposing that he did perform it?&nbsp; Again, the history gives 
an account of a certain book called the &ldquo;Sleeping 
Bard,&rdquo; the most remarkable prose work of the most difficult
language but one, of modern Europe,&mdash;a book, for a notice of
which, he believes, one might turn over in vain the pages of any 
review printed in England, or, indeed, elsewhere.&mdash;So here 
are <!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>two facts, one literary and the 
other physiological, for which any candid critic was bound to 
thank the author, even as in the Romany Rye there is a fact 
connected with Iro Norman Myth, for the disclosing of which any 
person who pretends to have a regard for literature is bound to 
thank him, namely, that the mysterious Finn or Fingal of 
&ldquo;Ossian&rsquo;s Poems&rdquo; is one and the same person as 
the Sigurd Fofnisbane of the Edda and the Wilkina, and the 
Siegfried Horn of the Lay of the Niebelungs.</p>
<p>The writer might here conclude, and, he believes, most 
triumphantly; as, however, he is in the cue for writing, which he
seldom is, he will for his own gratification, and for the sake of
others, dropping metaphors about vipers and serpents, show up in 
particular two or three sets or cliques of people, who, he is 
happy to say, have been particularly virulent against him and his
work, for nothing indeed could have given him greater 
mortification than their praise.</p>
<p>In the first place, he wishes to dispose of certain 
individuals who call themselves men of wit and 
fashion&mdash;about town&mdash;who he is told have abused his 
book &ldquo;vaustly&rdquo;&mdash;their own word.&nbsp; These 
people paint their cheeks, wear white kid gloves, and dabble in 
literature, or what they conceive to be literature.&nbsp; For 
abuse from such people, the writer was prepared.&nbsp; Does any 
one imagine that the writer was not well aware, before he 
published his book, that, whenever he gave it to the world, he 
should be attacked by every literary coxcomb in England who had 
influence enough to procure the insertion of a scurrilous article
in a magazine or newspaper!&nbsp; He has been in Spain, and has 
seen how invariably the mule attacks the horse; now why does the 
mule attack the horse?&nbsp; Why, because the latter carries 
about with him that which the envious hermaphrodite does not 
possess.</p>
<p>They consider, forsooth, that his book is low&mdash;but he is 
not going to waste words about them&mdash;one or two of whom, he 
is told, have written very duncie books about Spain, and are 
highly enraged with him, because certain books which he wrote 
about Spain were not considered duncie.&nbsp; No, he is not going
to waste words upon them, for verily he dislikes their company, 
and so he&rsquo;ll pass them by, and proceed to others.</p>
<p>The Scotch Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people have been very 
loud in the abuse of Lavengro&mdash;this again might be expected;
the sarcasms of the Priest about the Charlie o&rsquo;er the water
nonsense of course stung them.&nbsp; Oh! it is one of the claims 
which Lavengro has to respect, that it is the first, if not the 
only work, in which that nonsense is, to a certain extent, 
exposed.&nbsp; Two or three of their remarks on passages of 
Lavengro, he will reproduce and laugh at.&nbsp; Of course your 
Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people are genteel exceedingly, and 
cannot abide anything low.&nbsp; Gypsyism they think is 
particularly low, and the use of gypsy words in literature 
beneath its gentility; so they object to gypsy words being used 
in Lavengro <!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>where gypsies are introduced 
speaking&mdash;&ldquo;What is Romany forsooth?&rdquo; say 
they.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; And what is Scotch? has not the 
public been nauseated with Scotch for the last thirty 
years?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, but Scotch is not&rdquo;&mdash;the writer
believes he knows much better than the Scotch what Scotch is and 
what it is not; he has told them before what it is, a very sorry 
jargon.&nbsp; He will now tell them what it is not&mdash;a sister
or an immediate daughter of the Sanscrit, which Romany is.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ay, but the Scotch are&rdquo;&mdash;foxes, foxes, nothing 
else than foxes, even like the gypsies&mdash;the difference 
between the gypsy and Scotch fox being that the first is wild, 
with a mighty brush, the other a sneak with a gilt collar and 
without a tail.</p>
<p>A Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person attempts to be witty, 
because the writer has said that perhaps a certain old Edinburgh 
High School porter, of the name of Boee, was perhaps of the same 
blood as a certain Bui, a Northern Kemp who distinguished himself
at the battle of Horinger Bay.&nbsp; A pretty matter, forsooth, 
to excite the ridicule of a Scotchman!&nbsp; Why, is there a 
beggar or trumpery fellow in Scotland who does not pretend to be 
somebody, or related to somebody?&nbsp; Is not every Scotchman 
descended from some king, kemp, or cow-stealer of old, by his own
account at least?&nbsp; Why, the writer would even go so far as 
to bet a trifle that the poor creature who ridicules Boee&rsquo;s
supposed ancestry, has one of his own, at least as grand and as 
apocryphal as old Boee&rsquo;s of the High School.</p>
<p>The same Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person is mightily 
indignant that Lavengro should have spoken disrespectfully of 
William Wallace; Lavengro, when he speaks of that personage, 
being a child of about ten years old, and repeating merely what 
he had heard.&nbsp; All the Scotch, by-the-bye, for a great many 
years past, have been great admirers of William Wallace, 
particularly the Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people, who in 
their nonsense-verses about Charlie generally contrive to bring 
in the name of William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace.&nbsp; The 
writer begs leave to say that he by no means wishes to bear hard 
against William Wallace, but he cannot help asking why, if 
William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace was such a particularly nice 
person, did his brother Scots betray him to a certain renowned 
southern warrior, called Edward Longshanks, who caused him to be 
hanged and cut into four in London, and his quarters to be placed
over the gates of certain towns?&nbsp; They got gold, it is true,
and titles, very nice things no doubt; but, surely, the life of a
patriot is better than all the gold and titles in the 
world&mdash;at least Lavengro thinks so,&mdash;but Lavengro has 
lived more with gypsies than Scotchmen, and gypsies do not betray
their brothers.&nbsp; It would be some time before a gypsy would 
hand over his brother to the harum-beck, even supposing you would
not only make him a king, but a justice of the peace, and not 
only give him the world, but the best farm on the Holkham estate;
but gypsies are wild foxes, and there is certainly a wonderful 
difference between <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>the way of thinking of the wild fox 
who retains his brush, and that of the scurvy kennel creature who
has lost his tail.</p>
<p>Ah! but thousands of Scotch, and particularly the Charlie 
o&rsquo;er the water people, will say, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t 
sell Willie Wallace, it was our forbears who sold Willie Wallace 
. . . If Edward Longshanks had asked us to sell Wullie Wallace, 
we would soon have shown him that&rdquo; . . . Lord better ye, ye
poor trumpery set of creatures, ye would not have acted a bit 
better than your forefathers; remember how ye have ever treated 
the few amongst ye who, though born in the kennel, have shown 
something of the spirit of the wood.&nbsp; Many of ye are still 
alive who delivered over men, quite as honest and patriotic as 
William Wallace, into the hands of an English minister, to be 
chained and transported for merely venturing to speak and write 
in the cause of humanity, at the time when Europe was beginning 
to fling off the chains imposed by kings and priests.&nbsp; And 
it is not so very long since Burns, to whom ye are now building 
up obelisks rather higher than he deserves, was permitted by his 
countrymen to die in poverty and misery, because he would not 
join with them in songs of adulation to kings and the trumpery 
great.&nbsp; So say not that ye would have acted with respect to 
William Wallace one whit better than your fathers&mdash;and you 
in particular, ye children of Charlie, whom do ye write 
nonsense-verses about?&nbsp; A family of dastard despots, who did
their best, during a century and more, to tread out the few 
sparks of independent feeling still glowing in Scotland&mdash;but
enough has been said about ye.&nbsp; Amongst those who have been 
prodigal in abuse and defamation of Lavengro, have been your 
modern Radicals, and particularly a set of people who filled the 
country with noise against the King and Queen, Wellington and the
Tories, in &rsquo;32.&nbsp; About these people the writer will 
presently have occasion to say a good deal, and also of real 
Radicals.&nbsp; As, however, it may be supposed that he is one of
those who delight to play the sycophant to kings and queens, to 
curry favour with Tories, and to bepraise Wellington, he begs 
leave to state that such is not the case.</p>
<p>About kings and queens he has nothing to say; about Tories, 
simply that he believes them to be a bad set; about Wellington, 
however, it will be necessary for him to say a good deal, of 
mixed import, as he will subsequently frequently have occasion to
mention him in connection with what he has to say about 
pseudo-Radicals.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; PSEUDO-RADICALS.</h3>
<p>About Wellington, then, he says, that he believes him at the 
present day to be infinitely overrated.&nbsp; But there certainly
was a <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>time when he was shamefully 
underrated.&nbsp; Now what time was that?&nbsp; Why, the time of 
pseudo-radicalism, <i>par excellence</i>, from &rsquo;20 to 
&rsquo;32.&nbsp; Oh, the abuse that was heaped on Wellington by 
those who traded in radical cant&mdash;your newspaper editors and
review writers! and how he was sneered at then by your Whigs, and
how faintly supported he was by your Tories, who were half 
ashamed of him; for your Tories, though capital fellows as 
followers, when you want nobody to back you, are the faintest 
creatures in the world when you cry in your agony, &ldquo;Come 
and help me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, assuredly Wellington was infamously
used at that time, especially by your traders in Radicalism, who 
howled at and hooted him; said he had every vice&mdash;was no 
general&mdash;was beaten at Waterloo&mdash;was a 
poltroon&mdash;moreover, a poor illiterate creature, who could 
scarcely read or write; nay, a principal Radical paper said 
bodily he could not read, and devised an ingenious plan for 
teaching Wellington how to read.&nbsp; Now this was too bad; and 
the writer, being a lover of justice, frequently spoke up for 
Wellington, saying that as for vice, he was not worse than his 
neighbours; that he was brave; that he won the fight at Waterloo,
from a half-dead man, it is true, but that he did win it.&nbsp; 
Also, that he believed he had read &ldquo;Rules for the Manual 
and Platoon Exercises&rdquo; to some purpose; moreover, that he 
was sure he could write, for that he, the writer, had once 
written to Wellington, and had received an answer from him; nay, 
the writer once went so far as to strike a blow for Wellington; 
for the last time he used his fists was upon a Radical 
sub-editor, who was mobbing Wellington in the street, from behind
a rank of grimy fellows; but though the writer spoke up for 
Wellington to a certain extent when he was shamefully underrated,
and once struck a blow for him when he was about being hustled, 
he is not going to join in the loathsome sycophantic nonsense 
which it has been the fashion to use with respect to Wellington 
these last twenty years.&nbsp; Now what have those years been to 
England?&nbsp; Why, the years of ultra-gentility, everybody in 
England having gone gentility mad during the last twenty years, 
and no people more so than your pseudo-Radicals.&nbsp; Wellington
was turned out, and your Whigs and Radicals got in, and then 
commenced the period of ultra-gentility in England.&nbsp; The 
Whigs and Radicals only hated Wellington as long as the patronage
of the country was in his hands, none of which they were 
tolerably sure he would bestow on them; but no sooner did they 
get it into their own, than they forthwith became admirers of 
Wellington.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because he was a duke, petted at
Windsor and by foreign princes, and a very genteel 
personage.&nbsp; Formerly many of your Whigs and Radicals had 
scarcely a decent coat on their backs; but now the plunder of the
country was at their disposal, and they had as good a chance of 
being genteel as any people.&nbsp; So they were willing to 
worship Wellington because he was very genteel, and could not 
keep the plunder of the country out of their hands.&nbsp; And 
Wellington has <!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>been worshipped, and prettily so, 
during the last fifteen or twenty years.&nbsp; He is now a noble,
fine-hearted creature; the greatest general the world ever 
produced; the bravest of men; and&mdash;and&mdash;mercy upon us! 
the greatest of military writers!&nbsp; Now the present writer 
will not join in such sycophancy.&nbsp; As he was not afraid to 
take the part of Wellington when he was scurvily used by all 
parties, and when it was dangerous to take his part, so he is not
afraid to speak the naked truth about Wellington in these days, 
when it is dangerous to say anything about him but what is 
sycophantically laudatory.&nbsp; He said, in &rsquo;32, that as 
to vice, Wellington was not worse than his neighbours; but he is 
not going to say, in &rsquo;54, that Wellington was a 
noble-hearted fellow; for he believes that a more cold-hearted 
individual never existed.&nbsp; His conduct to Warner, the poor 
Vaudois, and Marshal Ney, showed that.&nbsp; He said, in 
&rsquo;32, that he was a good general and a brave man; but he is 
not going, in &rsquo;54, to say that he was the best general, or 
the bravest man the world ever saw.&nbsp; England has produced a 
better general&mdash;France two or three&mdash;both countries 
many braver men.&nbsp; The son of the Norfolk clergyman was a 
braver man; Marshal Ney was a braver man.&nbsp; Oh, that battle 
of Copenhagen!&nbsp; Oh, that covering the retreat of the Grand 
Army!&nbsp; And though he said in &rsquo;32 that he could write, 
he is not going to say in &rsquo;54 that he is the best of all 
military writers.&nbsp; On the contrary, he does not hesitate to 
say that any Commentary of Julius C&aelig;sar, or any chapter in 
Justinus, more especially the one about the Parthians, is worth 
the ten volumes of Wellington&rsquo;s Despatches; though he has 
no doubt that, by saying so, he shall especially rouse the 
indignation of a certain newspaper, at present one of the most 
genteel journals imaginable&mdash;with a slight tendency to 
liberalism, it is true, but perfectly genteel&mdash;which is 
nevertheless the very one which, in &rsquo;32, swore bodily that 
Wellington could neither read nor write, and devised an ingenious
plan for teaching him how to read.</p>
<p>Now, after the above statement, no one will venture to say, if
the writer should be disposed to bear hard upon Radicals, that he
would be influenced by a desire to pay court to princes, or to 
curry favour with Tories, or from being a blind admirer of the 
Duke of Wellington; but the writer is not going to declaim 
against Radicals, that is, real Republicans, or their principles;
upon the whole, he is something of an admirer of both.&nbsp; The 
writer has always had as much admiration for everything that is 
real and honest as he has had contempt for the opposite.&nbsp; 
Now real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, a much 
finer thing than Toryism, a system of common robbery, which is 
nevertheless far better than Whiggism <a 
name="citation351"></a><a href="#footnote351" 
class="citation">[351]</a>&mdash;a compound of petty larceny, 
popular instruction, and <!-- page 352--><a 
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>receiving 
of stolen goods.&nbsp; Yes, real Republicanism is certainly a 
very fine thing, and your real Radicals and Republicans are 
certainly very fine fellows, or rather were fine fellows, for the
Lord only knows where to find them at the present day&mdash;the 
writer does not.&nbsp; If he did, he would at any time go five 
miles to invite one of them to dinner, even supposing that he had
to go to a workhouse in order to find the person he wished to 
invite.&nbsp; Amongst the real Radicals of England, those who 
flourished from the year &rsquo;16 to &rsquo;20, there were 
certainly extraordinary characters, men partially insane, 
perhaps, but honest and brave&mdash;they did not make a market of
the principles which they professed, and never intended to do so;
they believed in them, and were willing to risk their lives in 
endeavouring to carry them out.&nbsp; The writer wishes to speak 
in particular of two of these men, both of whom perished on the 
scaffold&mdash;their names were Thistlewood and Ings.&nbsp; 
Thistlewood, the best known of them, was a brave soldier, and had
served with distinction as an officer in the French service: he 
was one of the excellent swordsmen of Europe; had fought several 
duels in France, where it is no child&rsquo;s play to fight a 
duel; but had never unsheathed his sword for single combat, but 
in defence of the feeble and insulted&mdash;he was kind and 
open-hearted, but of too great simplicity; he had once ten 
thousand pounds left him, all of which he lent to a friend, who 
disappeared and never returned him a penny.&nbsp; Ings was an 
uneducated man, of very low stature, but amazing strength and 
resolution, he was a kind husband and father, and though a humble
butcher, the name he bore was one of the royal names of the 
heathen Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; These two men, along with five 
others, were executed, and their heads hacked off, for levying 
war against George the Fourth; the whole seven dying in a manner 
which extorted cheers from the populace; the most of them 
uttering philosophical or patriotic sayings.&nbsp; Thistlewood, 
who was, perhaps, the most calm and collected of all, just before
he was turned off, <!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>said, &ldquo;We are now going to 
discover the great secret.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ings, the moment before 
he was choked, was singing &ldquo;Scots wha ha&rsquo; wi&rsquo; 
Wallace bled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now there was no humbug about those 
men, nor about many more of the same time and of the same 
principles.&nbsp; They might be deluded about Republicanism, as 
Algernon Sidney was, and as Brutus was, but they were as honest 
and brave as either Brutus or Sidney; and as willing to die for 
their principles.&nbsp; But the Radicals who succeeded them were 
beings of a very different description; they jobbed and traded in
Republicanism, and either parted with it, or at the present day 
are eager to part with it for a consideration.&nbsp; In order to 
get the Whigs into power, and themselves places, they brought the
country by their inflammatory language to the verge of a 
revolution, and were the cause that many perished on the 
scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and newspaper articles 
they caused the Bristol conflagration, for which six poor 
creatures were executed; they encouraged the mob to pillage, pull
down and burn, and then rushing into garrets looked on.&nbsp; 
Thistlewood tells the mob the Tower is a second Bastile; let it 
be pulled down.&nbsp; A mob tries to pull down the Tower; but 
Thistlewood is at the head of that mob; he is not peeping from a 
garret on Tower Hill like Gulliver at Lisbon.&nbsp; Thistlewood 
and Ings say to twenty ragged individuals, Liverpool and 
Castlereagh are two satellites of despotism; it would be highly 
desirable to put them out of the way.&nbsp; And a certain number 
of ragged individuals are surprised in a stable in Cato Street, 
making preparations to put Castlereagh and Liverpool out of the 
way, and are fired upon with muskets by Grenadiers, and are 
hacked at with cutlasses by Bow Street runners; but the twain who
encouraged those ragged individuals to meet in Cato Street are 
not far off, they are not on the other side of the river, in the 
Borough, for example, in some garret or obscure cellar.&nbsp; The
very first to confront the Guards and runners are Thistlewood and
Ings; Thistlewood whips his long thin rapier through 
Smithers&rsquo; lungs, and Ings makes a dash at Fitzclarence with
his butcher&rsquo;s knife.&nbsp; Oh, there was something in those
fellows! honesty and courage&mdash;but can as much be said for 
the inciters of the troubles of &rsquo;32.&nbsp; No; they egged 
on poor ignorant mechanics and rustics, and got them hanged for 
pulling down and burning, whilst the highest pitch to which their
own daring ever mounted was to mob Wellington as he passed in the
streets.</p>
<p>Now, these people were humbugs, which Thistlewood and Ings 
were not.&nbsp; They raved and foamed against kings, queens, 
Wellington, the aristocracy, and what not, till they had got the 
Whigs into power, with whom they were in secret alliance, and 
with whom they afterwards openly joined in a system of robbery 
and corruption, more flagitious than the old Tory one, because 
there was more cant about it; for themselves they got 
consulships, commissionerships, and in some instances 
governments; for their sons clerkships in <!-- page 354--><a 
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>public 
offices; and there you may see those sons with the never-failing 
badge of the low scoundrel-puppy, the gilt chain at the waistcoat
pocket; and there you may hear and see them using the languishing
tones, and employing the airs and graces which wenches use and 
employ, who, without being in the family way, wish to make their 
keepers believe that they are in the family way.&nbsp; Assuredly 
great is the cleverness of your Radicals of &rsquo;32, in 
providing for themselves and their families.&nbsp; Yet, clever as
they are, there is one thing they cannot do&mdash;they get 
governments for themselves, commissionerships for their brothers,
clerkships for their sons, but there is one thing beyond their 
craft&mdash;they cannot get husbands for their daughters, who, 
too ugly for marriage, and with their heads filled with the 
nonsense they have imbibed from gentility novels, go over from 
Socinus to the Pope, becoming sisters in fusty convents, or 
having heard a few sermons in Mr. Platitude&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;chapelle,&rdquo; seek for admission at the establishment 
of mother S . . ., who, after employing them for a time in 
various menial offices, and making them pluck off their eyebrows 
hair by hair, generally dismisses them on the plea of 
sluttishness; whereupon they return to their papas to eat the 
bread of the country, with the comfortable prospect of eating it 
still in the shape of a pension after their sires are dead.&nbsp;
Papa (<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>) living as quietly as he can; not
exactly enviably it is true, being now and then seen to cast an 
uneasy and furtive glance behind, even as an animal is wont, who 
has lost by some mischance a very sightly appendage; as quietly 
however as he can, and as dignifiedly, a great admirer of every 
genteel thing and genteel personage, the Duke in particular, 
whose &ldquo;Despatches,&rdquo; bound in red morocco, you will 
find on his table.&nbsp; A disliker of coarse expressions, and 
extremes of every kind, with a perfect horror for revolutions and
attempts to revolutionise, exclaiming now and then, as a shriek 
escapes from whipped and bleeding Hungary, a groan from gasping 
Poland, and a half-stifled curse from downtrodden but scowling 
Italy, &ldquo;Confound the revolutionary canaille, why 
can&rsquo;t it be quiet!&rdquo; in a word, putting one in mind of
the parvenu in the &ldquo;Walpurgis Nacht.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
writer is no admirer of G&ouml;the, but the idea of that parvenu 
was certainly a good one.&nbsp; Yes, putting one in mind of the 
individual who says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wir waren wahrlich auch nicht dumm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und thaten oft was wir nicht sollten;<br />
Doch jetzo kehrt sich alles um und um,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und eben da wir&rsquo;s fest erhalten 
wollten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were no fools, as every one discern&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stopp&rsquo;d at nought our projects in 
fulfilling;<br />
But now the world seems topsy-turvy turn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep it quiet just when we were willing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this class of individuals entertain a mortal hatred for 
<!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
355</span>Lavengro and its writer, and never lose an opportunity 
of vituperating both.&nbsp; It is true that such hatred is by no 
means surprising.&nbsp; There is certainly a great deal of 
difference between Lavengro and their own sons; the one thinking 
of independence, and philology, whilst he is clinking away at 
kettles, and hammering horse-shoes in dingles; the others stuck 
up at public offices with gilt chains at their waistcoat-pockets,
and giving themselves the airs and graces of females of a certain
description.&nbsp; And there certainly <i>is</i> a great deal of 
difference between the author of Lavengro and themselves&mdash;he
retaining his principles and his brush; they with scarlet 
breeches on, it is true, but without their republicanism and 
their tails.&nbsp; Oh, the writer can well afford to be 
vituperated by your pseudo-Radicals of &rsquo;32!</p>
<p>Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and 
his wife; but the matter is too rich not to require a chapter to 
itself.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; THE OLD RADICAL.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This very dirty man, with his very dirty 
face,<br />
Would do any dirty act, which would get him a place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and 
his wife; but before he relates the manner in which they set upon
him, it will be as well to enter upon a few particulars tending 
to elucidate their reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he 
met at the table of a certain Anglo-Germanist, an individual, 
apparently somewhat under thirty, of middle stature, a thin and 
weaselly figure, a sallow complexion, a certain obliquity of 
vision, and a large pair of spectacles.&nbsp; This person, who 
had lately come from abroad, and had published a volume of 
translations, had attracted some slight notice in the literary 
world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a small 
provincial capital.&nbsp; After dinner he argued a great deal, 
spoke vehemently against the Church, and uttered the most 
desperate Radicalism that was perhaps ever heard, saying, he 
hoped that in a short time there would not be a king or queen in 
Europe, and enveighing bitterly against the English aristocracy, 
and against the Duke of Wellington in particular, whom, he said, 
if he himself was ever president of an English republic&mdash;an 
event which he seemed to think by no means improbable&mdash;he 
would hang for certain infamous acts of profligacy and bloodshed 
which he had perpetrated in Spain.&nbsp; Being informed that the 
writer was something of a philologist, to which character the 
individual in question laid great pretensions, he came and sat 
down by him, and talked about <!-- page 356--><a 
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>languages 
and literature.&nbsp; The writer, who was only a boy, was a 
little frightened at first, but, not wishing to appear a child of
absolute ignorance, he summoned what little learning he had, and 
began to blunder out something about the Celtic languages and 
their literature, and asked the Lion who he conceived Finn Ma 
Coul to be? and whether he did not consider the &ldquo;Ode to the
Fox,&rdquo; by Red Rhys of Eryry, to be a masterpiece of 
pleasantry?&nbsp; Receiving no answer to these questions from the
Lion, who, singular enough, would frequently, when the writer put
a question to him, look across the table, and flatly contradict 
some one who was talking to some other person, the writer dropped
the Celtic languages and literature, and asked him whether he did
not think it a funny thing that Temugin, generally called Genghis
Khan, should have married the daughter of Prester John? <a 
name="citation356"></a><a href="#footnote356" 
class="citation">[356]</a>&nbsp; The Lion, after giving a 
side-glance at the writer through his left spectacle glass, 
seemed about to reply, but was unfortunately prevented, being 
seized with an irresistible impulse to contradict a respectable 
doctor of medicine, who was engaged in conversation with the 
master of the house at the upper and farther end of the table, 
the writer, being a poor ignorant lad, sitting of course at the 
bottom.&nbsp; The doctor, who had served in the Peninsula, having
observed that Ferdinand the Seventh was not quite so bad as had 
been represented, the Lion vociferated that he was ten times 
worse, and that he hoped to see him and the Duke of Wellington 
hanged together.&nbsp; The doctor, who, being a Welshman, was 
somewhat of a warm temper, growing rather red, said that at any 
rate he had been informed that Ferdinand the Seventh knew 
sometimes how to behave himself like a gentleman&mdash;this 
brought on a long dispute, which terminated rather 
abruptly.&nbsp; The Lion having observed that the doctor must not
talk about Spanish matters with one who had visited every part of
Spain, the doctor bowed and said he was right, for that he 
believed no people in general possessed such accurate information
about countries as those who had travelled them as bagmen.&nbsp; 
On the Lion asking the doctor what he meant, the Welshman, whose 
under jaw began to move violently, replied that he meant what he 
said.&nbsp; Here the matter ended, for the Lion, turning from 
him, looked at the writer.&nbsp; The writer, imagining that his 
own conversation hitherto had been too trivial and commonplace 
for the Lion to consider it worth his while to take much notice 
of it, determined to assume a little higher ground, and after 
repeating a few verses of the Koran, and gabbling a little 
Arabic, asked the Lion what he considered to be the difference 
between the Hegira and the Christian era, adding that he thought 
the general computation was in error by about one year; and being
a particularly modest person, chiefly, he believes, owing to his 
having been at school in Ireland, absolutely blushed at finding 
that the Lion <!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>returned not a word in answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a wonderful individual I am seated by,&rdquo; thought
he, &ldquo;to whom Arabic seems a vulgar speech, and a question 
about the Hegira not worthy of an answer!&rdquo; not reflecting 
that as lions come from the Saharra, they have quite enough of 
Arabic at home, and that the question about the Hegira was rather
mal &agrave; propos to one used to prey on the flesh of 
hadjis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I only wish he would vouchsafe me a 
little of his learning,&rdquo; thought the boy to himself, and in
this wish he was at last gratified; for the Lion, after asking 
him whether he was acquainted at all with the Sclavonian 
languages, and being informed that he was not, absolutely 
dumbfoundered him by a display of Sclavonian erudition.</p>
<p>Years rolled by&mdash;the writer was a good deal about, 
sometimes in London, sometimes in the country, sometimes abroad; 
in London he occasionally met the man of the spectacles, who was 
always very civil to him, and indeed cultivated his 
acquaintance.&nbsp; The writer thought it rather odd that, after 
he himself had become acquainted with the Sclavonian languages 
and literature, the man of the spectacles talked little or 
nothing about them.&nbsp; In a little time, however, the matter 
ceased to cause him the slightest surprise, for he had discovered
a key to the mystery.&nbsp; In the meantime, the man of the 
spectacles was busy enough; he speculated in commerce, failed, 
and paid his creditors twenty pennies in the pound; published 
translations, of which the public at length became heartily 
tired; having, indeed, got an inkling of the manner in which 
those translations were got up.&nbsp; He managed, however, to 
ride out many a storm, having one trusty 
sheet-anchor&mdash;Radicalism.&nbsp; This he turned to the best 
advantage&mdash;writing pamphlets and articles in reviews, all in
the Radical interest, and for which he was paid out of the 
Radical fund; which articles and pamphlets, when Toryism seemed 
to reel on its last legs, exhibited a slight tendency to 
Whiggism.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his abhorrence of desertion of 
principle was so great in the time of the Duke of 
Wellington&rsquo;s administration, that when S . . . left the 
Whigs and went over, he told the writer, who was about that time 
engaged with him in a literary undertaking, that the said S . . .
was a fellow with a character so infamous, that any honest man 
would rather that you should spit in his face, than insult his 
ears with the mention of the name of S . . .</p>
<p>The literary project having come to nothing,&mdash;in which, 
by-the-bye, the writer was to have all the labour, and his friend
all the credit, provided any credit should accrue from 
it,&mdash;the writer did not see the latter for some years, 
during which time considerable political changes took place; the 
Tories were driven from, and the Whigs placed in, office, both 
events being brought about by the Radicals coalescing with the 
Whigs, over whom they possessed great influence for the services 
which they had rendered.&nbsp; When the writer next visited his 
friend, he found him very much altered; his opinions were by no 
means so exalted as they had been&mdash;he was not disposed even 
to be rancorous against the Duke of <!-- page 358--><a 
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>Wellington,
saying that there were worse men than he, and giving him some 
credit as a general; a hankering after gentility seeming to 
pervade the whole family, father and sons, wife and daughters, 
all of whom talked about genteel diversions&mdash;gentility 
novels, and even seemed to look with favour on high Churchism, 
having in former years, to all appearance, been bigoted 
Dissenters.&nbsp; In a little time the writer went abroad; as, 
indeed, did his friend; not, however, like the writer, at his own
expense, but at that of the country&mdash;the Whigs having given 
him a travelling appointment, which he held for some years, 
during which he is said to have received upwards of twelve 
thousand pounds of the money of the country, for services which 
will, perhaps, be found inscribed on certain tablets, when 
another Astolfo shall visit the moon.&nbsp; This appointment, 
however, he lost on the Tories resuming power&mdash;when the 
writer found him almost as radical and patriotic as ever, just 
engaged in trying to get into Parliament, into which he got by 
the assistance of his Radical friends, who, in conjunction with 
the Whigs, were just getting up a crusade against the Tories, 
which they intended should be a conclusive one.</p>
<p>A little time after the publication of &ldquo;The Bible in 
Spain,&rdquo; the Tories being still in power, this individual, 
full of the most disinterested friendship for the author, was 
particularly anxious that he should be presented with an official
situation, in a certain region a great many miles off.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You are the only person for that appointment,&rdquo; said 
he; &ldquo;you understand a great deal about the country, and are
better acquainted with the two languages spoken there than any 
one in England.&nbsp; Now I love my country, and have, moreover, 
a great regard for you, and as I am in Parliament, and have 
frequent opportunities of speaking to the Ministry, I shall take 
care to tell them how desirable it would be to secure your 
services.&nbsp; It is true they are Tories, but I think that even
Tories would give up their habitual love of jobbery in a case 
like yours, and for once show themselves disposed to be honest 
men and gentlemen; indeed, I have no doubt they will, for having 
so deservedly an infamous character, they would be glad to get 
themselves a little credit, by a presentation which could not 
possibly be traced to jobbery or favouritism.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
writer begged his friend to give himself no trouble about the 
matter, as he was not desirous of the appointment, being in 
tolerably easy circumstances, and willing to take some rest after
a life of labour.&nbsp; All, however, that he could say was of no
use, his friend indignantly observing that the matter ought to be
taken entirely out of his hands, and the appointment thrust upon 
him for the credit of the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;But may not many 
people be far more worthy of the appointment than myself?&rdquo; 
said the writer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said the friendly 
Radical.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get it, it will be made 
a job of, given to the son of some steward, or perhaps to some 
quack who has done dirty work; I tell you what, I shall ask it 
for you, in spite of you; I shall, indeed!&rdquo; and <!-- page 
359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
359</span>his eyes flashed with friendly and patriotic fervour 
through the large pair of spectacles which he wore.</p>
<p>And, in fact, it would appear that the honest and friendly 
patriot put his threat into execution.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
spoken,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;more than once to this and that 
individual in Parliament, and everybody seems to think that the 
appointment should be given to you.&nbsp; Nay, that you should be
forced to accept it.&nbsp; I intend next to speak to Lord A . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he did, at least it would appear so.&nbsp; 
On the writer calling upon him one evening, about a week 
afterwards, in order to take leave of him, as the writer was 
about to take a long journey for the sake of his health, his 
friend no sooner saw him than he started up in a violent fit of 
agitation, and glancing about the room, in which there were 
several people, amongst others two Whig members of Parliament, 
said, &ldquo;I am glad you are come; I was just speaking about 
you.&nbsp; This,&rdquo; said he, addressing the two members, 
&ldquo;is so and so, the author of so and so, the well-known 
philologist; as I was telling you, I spoke to Lord A . . . this 
day about him, and said that he ought forthwith to have the head 
appointment in . . .; and what did the fellow say?&nbsp; Why, 
that there was no necessity for such an appointment at all, and 
if there were, why . . . and then he hummed and ha&rsquo;d.&nbsp;
Yes,&rdquo; said he, looking at the writer, &ldquo;he did 
indeed.&nbsp; What a scandal! what an infamy!&nbsp; But I see how
it will be, it will be a job.&nbsp; The place will be given to 
some son of a steward or to some quack, as I said before.&nbsp; 
Oh, these Tories!&nbsp; Well, if this does not make one . . 
.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he stopped short, crunched his teeth, and 
looked the image of desperation.</p>
<p>Seeing the poor man in this distressed condition, the writer 
begged him to be comforted, and not to take the matter so much to
heart; but the indignant Radical took the matter very much to 
heart, and refused all comfort whatever, bouncing about the room,
and, whilst his spectacles flashed in the light of four 
spermaceti candles, exclaiming, &ldquo;It will be a job&mdash;a 
Tory job!&nbsp; I see it all, I see it all, I see it 
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a job it proved, and a very pretty job, but no Tory job; 
shortly afterwards the Tories were out, and the Whigs were 
in.&nbsp; From that time the writer heard not a word about the 
injustice done to the country in not presenting him with the 
appointment to . . .; the Radical, however, was busy enough to 
obtain the appointment, not for the writer, but for himself, and 
eventually succeeded, partly through Radical influence, and 
partly through that of a certain Whig lord, for whom the Radical 
had done, on a particular occasion, work of a particular 
kind.&nbsp; So, though the place was given to a quack, and the 
whole affair a very pretty job, it was one in which the Tories 
had certainly no hand.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, however, the friendly Radical did not drop 
the writer.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; On various occasions he obtained 
from the writer all the information he could about the country in
question, <!-- page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>and was particularly anxious to 
obtain from the writer, and eventually did obtain, a copy of a 
work written in the court language of that country, edited by the
writer.&nbsp; A language exceedingly difficult, which the writer,
at the expense of a considerable portion of his eyesight, had 
acquired, at least as far as by the eyesight it could be 
acquired.&nbsp; What use the writer&rsquo;s friend made of the 
knowledge he had gained from him, and what use he made of the 
book, the writer can only guess; but he has little doubt that 
when the question of sending a person to . . . was mooted in a 
Parliamentary Committee&mdash;which it was at the instigation of 
the Radical supporters of the writer&rsquo;s friend&mdash;the 
Radical, on being examined about the country, gave the 
information which he had obtained from the writer as his own, and
flashed the book and its singular characters in the eyes of the 
Committee; and then of course his Radical friends would instantly
say, &ldquo;This is the man! there is no one like him.&nbsp; See 
what information he possesses; and see that book written by 
himself in the court language of Serendib.&nbsp; This is the only
man to send there.&nbsp; What a glory, what a triumph it would be
to Britain, to send out a man so deeply versed in the mysterious 
lore of . . ., as our illustrious countryman; a person who with 
his knowledge could beat with their own weapons the wise men of .
. .&nbsp; Is such an opportunity to be lost?&nbsp; Oh, no! surely
not; if it is, it will be an eternal disgrace to England, and the
world will see that Whigs are no better than Tories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let no one think the writer uncharitable in these 
suppositions.&nbsp; The writer is only too well acquainted with 
the antecedents of the individual to entertain much doubt that he
would shrink from any such conduct, provided he thought that his 
temporal interest would be forwarded by it.&nbsp; The writer is 
aware of more than one instance in which he has passed off the 
literature of friendless young men for his own, after making them
a slight pecuniary compensation, and deforming what was 
originally excellent by interpolations of his own.&nbsp; This was
his especial practice with regard to translation, of which he 
would fain be esteemed the king.&nbsp; This Radical literato is 
slightly acquainted with four or five of the easier dialects of 
Europe, on the strength of which knowledge he would fain pass for
a universal linguist, publishing translations of pieces 
originally written in various difficult languages; which 
translations, however, were either made by himself from literal 
renderings done for him into French or German, or had been made 
from the originals into English, by friendless young men, and 
then deformed by his alterations.</p>
<p>Well, the Radical got the appointment, and the writer 
certainly did not grudge it him.&nbsp; He, of course, was aware 
that his friend had behaved in a very base manner towards him, 
but he bore him no ill-will, and invariably when he heard him 
spoken against, which was frequently the case, took his part when
no other person <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>would; indeed, he could well afford 
to bear him no ill-will.&nbsp; He had never sought for the 
appointment, nor wished for it, nor, indeed, ever believed 
himself qualified for it.&nbsp; He was conscious, it is true, 
that he was not altogether unacquainted with the language and 
literature of the country with which the appointment was 
connected.&nbsp; He was likewise aware that he was not altogether
deficient in courage and in propriety of behaviour.&nbsp; He knew
that his appearance was not particularly against him; his face 
not being like that of a convicted pickpocket, nor his gait 
resembling that of a fox who has lost his tail; yet he never 
believed himself adapted for the appointment, being aware that he
had no aptitude for the doing of dirty work, if called to do it, 
nor pliancy which would enable him to submit to scurvy treatment,
whether he did dirty work or not&mdash;requisites, at the time of
which he is speaking, indispensable in every British official; 
requisites, by-the-bye, which his friend, the Radical, possessed 
in a high degree; but though he bore no ill-will towards his 
friend, his friend bore anything but good-will towards him; for 
from the moment that he had obtained the appointment for himself,
his mind was filled with the most bitter malignity against the 
writer, and naturally enough; for no one ever yet behaved in a 
base manner towards another without forthwith conceiving a mortal
hatred against him.&nbsp; You wrong another, know yourself to 
have acted basely, and are enraged, not against 
yourself&mdash;for no one hates himself&mdash;but against the 
innocent cause of your baseness; reasoning very plausibly, 
&ldquo;But for that fellow, I should never have been base; for 
had he not existed I could not have been so, at any rate against 
him;&rdquo; and this hatred is all the more bitter when you 
reflect that you have been needlessly base.</p>
<p>Whilst the Tories are in power the writer&rsquo;s friend, of 
his own accord, raves against the Tories because they do not give
the writer a certain appointment, and makes, or says he makes, 
desperate exertions to make them do so; but no sooner are the 
Tories out, with whom he has no influence, and the Whigs in, with
whom he, or rather his party, has influence, than he gets the 
place for himself, though, according to his own expressed 
opinion&mdash;an opinion with which the writer does not, and 
never did, concur&mdash;the writer was the only person competent 
to hold it.&nbsp; Now had he, without saying a word to the 
writer, or about the writer with respect to the employment, got 
the place for himself when he had an opportunity, knowing, as he 
very well knew, himself to be utterly unqualified for it, the 
transaction, though a piece of jobbery, would not have merited 
the title of a base transaction; as the matter stands, however, 
who can avoid calling the whole affair not only a piece 
of&mdash;come, come, out with the word&mdash;scoundrelism on the 
part of the writer&rsquo;s friend, but a most curious piece of 
uncalled-for scoundrelism? and who, with any knowledge of fallen 
human nature, can wonder at the writer&rsquo;s friend 
entertaining towards him a considerable portion of gall and 
malignity?</p>
<p><!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>This feeling on the part of the writer&rsquo;s friend 
was wonderfully increased by the appearance of Lavengro, many 
passages of which the Radical in his foreign appointment applied 
to himself and family&mdash;one or two of his children having 
gone over to Popery, the rest become members of Mr. 
Platitude&rsquo;s chapel, and the minds of all being filled with 
ultra notions of gentility.</p>
<p>The writer, hearing that his old friend had returned to 
England, to apply, he believes, for an increase of salary and for
a title, called upon him, unwillingly, it is true, for he had no 
wish to see a person for whom, though he bore him no ill-will, he
could not avoid feeling a considerable portion of contempt; the 
truth is, that his sole object in calling was to endeavour to get
back a piece of literary property which his friend had obtained 
from him many years previously, and which, though he had 
frequently applied for it, he never could get back.&nbsp; Well, 
the writer called; he did not get his property, which, indeed, he
had scarcely time to press for, being almost instantly attacked 
by his good friend and his wife&mdash;yes, it was then that the 
author was set upon by an old Radical and his wife&mdash;the 
wife, who looked the very image of shame and malignity, did not 
say much, it is true, but encouraged her husband in all he 
said.&nbsp; Both of their own accord introduced the subject of 
Lavengro.&nbsp; The Radical called the writer a grumbler, just as
if there had ever been a greater grumbler than himself until, by 
the means above described, he had obtained a place: he said that 
the book contained a melancholy view of human nature&mdash;just 
as if anybody could look in his face without having a melancholy 
view of human nature.&nbsp; On the writer quietly observing that 
the book contained an exposition of his principles, the 
pseudo-Radical replied that he cared nothing for his 
principles&mdash;which was probably true, it not being likely 
that he would care for another person&rsquo;s principles after 
having shown so thorough a disregard for his own.&nbsp; The 
writer said that the book, of course, would give offence to 
humbugs; the Radical then demanded whether he thought him a 
humbug?&mdash;the wretched wife was the Radical&rsquo;s 
protection, even as he knew she would be; it was on her account 
that the writer did not kick his good friend; as it was, he 
looked at him in the face and thought to himself, &ldquo;How is 
it possible I should think you a humbug, when only last night I 
was taking your part in a company in which everybody called you a
humbug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Radical, probably observing something in the 
writer&rsquo;s eye which he did not like, became all on a sudden 
abjectly submissive, and, professing the highest admiration for 
the writer, begged him to visit him in his government; this the 
writer promised faithfully to do, and he takes the present 
opportunity of performing his promise.</p>
<p>This is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of Lavengro and
its author; were the writer on his death-bed he would lay his 
hand on his heart and say, that he does not believe that there is
one <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>trait of exaggeration in the 
portrait which he has drawn.&nbsp; This is one of the 
pseudo-Radical calumniators of Lavengro and its author; and this 
is one of the genus who, after having railed against jobbery for 
perhaps a quarter of a century, at present batten on large 
official salaries which they do not earn.&nbsp; England is a 
great country, and her interests require that she should have 
many a well-paid official both at home and abroad; but will 
England long continue a great country if the care of her 
interests, both at home and abroad, is in many instances 
intrusted to beings like him described above, whose only 
recommendation for an official appointment was that he was deeply
versed in the secrets of his party and of the Whigs?</p>
<p>Before he concludes, the writer will take the liberty of 
saying of Lavengro that it is a book written for the express 
purpose of inculcating virtue, love of country, learning, manly 
pursuits, and genuine religion, for example, that of the Church 
of England, and for awakening a contempt for nonsense of every 
kind, and a hatred for priestcraft, more especially that of 
Rome.</p>
<p>And in conclusion, with respect to many passages of his book 
in which he has expressed himself in terms neither measured nor 
mealy, he will beg leave to observe, in the words of a great 
poet, who lived a profligate life it is true, but who died a 
sincere penitent&mdash;thanks, after God, to good Bishop 
Burnet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All this with indignation I have 
hurl&rsquo;d<br />
At the pretending part of this proud world,<br />
Who, swollen with selfish vanity, devise<br />
False freedoms, formal cheats, and holy lies,<br />
Over their fellow fools to tyrannise.&rdquo;</p>

synonymous with Gentile and Gentoo; if so, the manner in which it
has been applied for ages ceases to surprise, for genteel is 
heathenish.&nbsp; Ideas of barbaric pearl and gold, glittering 
armour, plumes, tortures, blood-shedding, and lust, should always
be connected with it, Wace, in his grand Norman poem, calls the 
Baron genteel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La furent li gentil Baron,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he certainly could not have applied the word better than 
to the strong Norman thief, armed cap-a-pie, without one particle
of ruth or generosity; for a person to be a pink of gentility, 
that is heathenism, should have no such feelings; and, indeed, 
the admirers of gentility seldom or never associate any such 
feelings with it.&nbsp; It was from the Norman, the worst of all 
robbers and miscreants, who built strong castles, garrisoned them
with devils, and tore out poor wretches&rsquo; eyes, as the Saxon
Chronicle says, that the English got their detestable word 
genteel.&nbsp; What could ever have made the English such 
admirers of gentility, it would be difficult to say, for, during 
three hundred years, they suffered enough by it.&nbsp; Their 
genteel Norman landlords were their scourgers, their torturers, 
the plunderers of their homes, the dishonourers of their wives, 
and the deflowerers of their daughters.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all,
fear is at the root of the English veneration for gentility.</p>

derived from the same root as genteel; but nothing can be more

mean something kind and genial; genteel, that which is glittering
or gaudy.&nbsp; A person can be a gentleman in rags, but nobody 
can be genteel.</p>

which it was expedient for Scotchmen to check the children of any
county in England with the place of their birth, more especially 
those who have had the honour of being born in 
Norfolk&mdash;times in which British fleets, commanded by 
Scotchmen, have returned laden with anything but laurels from 
foreign shores.&nbsp; It would have been well for Britain had she

out in the midst of a vehement political contest, people may be 
led to suppose that the above was written expressly for the 
time.&nbsp; The writer therefore begs to state that it was 
written in the year 1854.&nbsp; He cannot help adding that he is 
neither Whig, Tory, nor Radical, and cares not a straw what party
governs England, provided it is governed well.&nbsp; But he has 
no hopes of good government from the Whigs.&nbsp; It is true that
amongst them there is one very great man, Lord Palmerston, who is
indeed the sword and buckler, the chariots and the horses of the 
party; but it is impossible for his lordship to govern well with 
such colleagues as he has&mdash;colleagues which have been forced
upon him by family influence, and who are continually pestering 
him into measures anything but conducive to the country&rsquo;s 
honour and interest.&nbsp; If Palmerston would govern well, he 
must get rid of them; but from that step, with all his courage 
and all his greatness, he will shrink.&nbsp; Yet how proper and 
easy a step it would be!&nbsp; He could easily get better, but 
scarcely worse, associates.&nbsp; They appear to have one object 
in view, and only one&mdash;jobbery.&nbsp; It was chiefly owing 
to a most flagitious piece of jobbery, which one of his 
lordship&rsquo;s principal colleagues sanctioned and promoted, 
that his lordship experienced his late parliamentary 
disasters.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
